title: Introduction to Computer Science with Python for Visually Impaired Students
level: beginner
description: |-
  This curriculum is designed to introduce a student with no vision to computer
  science concepts using Python, leveraging accessible tools and resources. It
  integrates the foundational concepts from Zelle's "Python Programming: An
  Introduction to Computer Science" with the practical, hands-on approach and
  text-based exercises from Eric Matthes' "Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition."
  The key is to focus on text-based output, console interaction, and carefully
  structured code that is easy for a screen reader to navigate.


  Accessibility Considerations for the Student:

      
  - VS Code and Screen Readers: The student will use VS Code with a screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver). VS Code has excellent accessibility features, including optimized screen reader mode, accessible view (Shift+Alt+F2), and navigation shortcuts (F8/Shift+F8 for errors).

        
  - Indentation: Python's reliance on indentation is crucial. The Python Indent and Indent Rainbow extensions in VS Code can provide visual cues, but for a screen reader user, consistent formatting and clear explanation of indentation rules are paramount. Encouraging the use of spaces (typically 4) over tabs for consistency is good practice.

        
  - Code Structure and Comments: Emphasize clear, well-commented code. Docstrings ("""Docstring here""") are excellent for describing functions and classes, and line comments (# Comment) for explaining logic.

        
  - Error Messages: Teach the student how to navigate and interpret Python error messages, as these are text-based and crucial for debugging.

        
  - Terminal Interaction: All program execution and output will be through the integrated terminal in VS Code, which is screen reader-friendly.

        
  - No turtle() Graphics: All graphical exercises from Zelle's curriculum will be replaced with text-based alternatives or concepts from Matthes that focus on data manipulation and console output.

    Target Audience: Students with no prior programming experience, relying on
    screen readers for all computer interactions.


    Tools:

        
  - Python 3 (latest stable version)

        
  - VS Code (Visual Studio Code)

        
  - A screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver)

        
  - Recommended VS Code Extensions:

            
    - Python (Official Microsoft extension)

            
    - Pylance (for IntelliSense, type checking)

            
    - Python Indent (for consistent indentation, though primary reliance is on good habits)

            
    - Better Comments (for highlighted comments - may or may not be useful depending on screen reader configuration)

            
    - Code Runner (for quick execution of Python files)
