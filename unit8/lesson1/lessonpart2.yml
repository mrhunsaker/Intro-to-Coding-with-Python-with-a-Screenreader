  # Lesson: Why Learn About Classes?


## Introduction to OOP concepts: objects, classes, encapsulation, abstraction.


Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful paradigm that allows
programmers to model real-world entities within their code. At its core, OOP
revolves around objects and classes. A class serves as a blueprint or a
template for creating objects. It defines the common characteristics (called
attributes) and behaviors (called methods) that all objects of that class will
possess. An object is an instance of a class\u2014a concrete entity created from
that blueprint.


## Activities


1. **Activity 7.1.1: Real-World Class Identification**


* Think of three different types of real-world objects (e.g., a \"Smartphone,\"
a \"Pet,\" a \"Book\").


* For each type, identify:

  * What would be its class name?

  * What are 3-4 common attributes?

  * What are 2-3 common methods?

* Share and discuss your ideas.\\\
