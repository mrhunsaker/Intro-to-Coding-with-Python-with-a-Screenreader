  # Lesson: Why Learn About Classes?


  ## Introduction to OOP concepts: objects, classes, encapsulation, abstraction.


  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful paradigm that allows
  programmers to model real-world entities within their code. At its core, OOP
  revolves around objects and classes. A class serves as a blueprint or a
  template for creating objects. It defines the common characteristics (called
  attributes) and behaviors (called methods) that all objects of that class will
  possess. An object is an instance of a classâ€”a concrete entity created from
  that blueprint.


  ## Activities


  1. **Activity 7.1.1: Real-World Class Identification**


  * Think of three different types of real-world objects (e.g., a "Smartphone,"
  a "Pet," a "Book").


  * For each type, identify:

    * What would be its class name?

    * What are 3-4 common attributes?

    * What are 2-3 common methods?

  * Share and discuss your ideas.
