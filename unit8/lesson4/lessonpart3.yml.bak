  Lesson 7.4: Inheritance
      • Student Materials:
          ◦ Outline:
              ▪ The concept of inheritance: creating a new class (child/subclass) based on an existing one (parent/superclass).
              ▪ Benefits of inheritance: code reuse, creating specialized versions of classes.
              ▪ Syntax for defining a child class that inherits from a parent.
              ▪ Using super().__init__() to call the parent class's __init__ method.
              ▪ Adding new attributes and methods to a child class.
              ▪ Overriding (redefining) methods from the parent class in the child class.
          ◦ Skills Checklist:
