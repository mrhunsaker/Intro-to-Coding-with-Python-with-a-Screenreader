  # Lesson: Creating and Using a Class


  ## Defining a simple class with attributes and the `__init__` method.


  Classes are defined using the `class` keyword. The `__init__` method
  initializes attributes.


  ## Example 7.2.1: Simple Dog Class


  ```python

  class Dog:
     """A simple attempt to model a dog."""

     def __init__(self, name, age):
         self.name = name
         self.age = age
         print(f"A new dog named {self.name} has been created!")

  my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)

  print(f"My dog's name is {my_dog.name}.")

  print(f"My dog is {my_dog.age} years old.")


  your_dog = Dog("Lucy", 1)

  print(f"Your dog's name is {your_dog.name}.")

  ```
