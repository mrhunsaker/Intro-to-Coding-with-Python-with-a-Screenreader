  Lesson 7.5: Instances as Attributes
      • Student Materials:
          ◦ Outline:
              ▪ The concept of "composition": one class containing an instance of another class as an attribute.
              ▪ When to use composition vs. inheritance (is-a vs. has-a relationship).
              ▪ Examples: A Car object might have a Engine object.
              ▪ Accessing attributes and methods of the nested instance.
          ◦ Skills Checklist:
              ▪ [ ] I can explain the concept of composition in OOP.
              ▪ [ ] I can identify scenarios where composition is more appropriate than inheritance.
              ▪ [ ] I can create an instance of one class and assign it as an attribute to another class.
