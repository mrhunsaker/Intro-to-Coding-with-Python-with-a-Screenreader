  - Lesson 7.5: Instances as Attributes 
- Student Materials: 
	- Outline: 
		-  The concept of "composition": one class containing an instance of another class as an attribute. 
		-  When to use composition vs. inheritance (is-a vs. has-a relationship). 
		-  Examples: A Car object might have a Engine object. 
		-  Accessing attributes and methods of the nested instance. 
	- Skills Checklist: 
		-  [ ] I can explain the concept of composition in OOP. 
		-  [ ] I can identify scenarios where composition is more appropriate than inheritance. 
		-  [ ] I can create an instance of one class and assign it as an attribute to another class. 
		-  [ ] I can access attributes and call methods of a nested object.
