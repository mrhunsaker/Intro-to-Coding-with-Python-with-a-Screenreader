  # Lesson: Your First Python Program: "Hello World!"


  The `print()` function serves as Python's primary method for communicating
  with the user.


  ## Explicit Examples


  ## Example 1.2.1: Simple Greeting


  ```python

  # This program prints a classic greeting.

  print("Hello, World!")

  ```


  Expected Output:


  ```

  Hello, World!

  ```


  ## Example 1.2.2: Personalized Message


  ```python

  # This program prints a message with your name.

  print("Hello, Alice!")

  print("Welcome to Python programming!")

  ```


  Expected Output:


  ```

  Hello, Alice!

  Welcome to Python programming!

  ```


  ## Activities


  1. **Activity 1.2.1: My First Message**

     1. Open VS Code and confirm that the PythonProjects folder is open.
     2. Create a new file as `my_message.py`.
     3. Type the following code, replacing with personal favorites:

        ```python
        print("My favorite color is blue.")
        print("My favorite animal is dog.")
        ```
     4. Save and run the file.
     5. Listen to the output.

  2. **Activity 1.2.2: Exploring Print Statements**

     1. Modify `my_message.py` or create `print_explorer.py`.
     2. Experiment with:

        * Printing numbers: `print(123)`

        * Printing sentences with punctuation.

        * Omitting quotes: `print(Hello)` (expect error)
     3. Save, run, and listen to output/errors.
