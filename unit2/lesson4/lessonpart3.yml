  Lesson 1.3: Variables and Simple Data Types
    • Student Materials:
      ◦ Outline:
        ▪ The concept of a variable as a container for storing information.
        ▪ Rules for naming variables (e.g., no spaces, can't start with a number).
        ▪ Introduction to string data type (text, enclosed in quotes).
        ▪ Introduction to integer data type (whole numbers).
        ▪ Introduction to float data type (numbers with decimal points).
        ▪ Assigning values to variables using the = operator.
        ▪ Using print() to display variable values.
        ▪ Performing simple arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) with numbers.
      ◦ Skills Checklist:
        ▪ [ ] I can define what a variable is in programming.
        ▪ [ ] I can create a valid variable name in Python.
        ▪ [ ] I can assign a string value to a variable.
        ▪ [ ] I can assign an integer value to a variable.
        ▪ [ ] I can assign a float value to a variable.
        ▪ [ ] I can use print() to display the value of a variable.
        ▪ [ ] I can perform basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with numbers in Python.
