  # Lesson: Welcome to Computer Science


  ## What is computer science? Hardware vs. Software. The role of programming.


  Computer science encompasses more than just writing code; it involves

  problem-solving, designing solutions, and understanding the intricate workings

  of computers. Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system

  that one can touch, such as the keyboard, speaker, processor, and memory. To

  illustrate this, consider a kitchen: the stove, refrigerator, and pots are

  analogous to hardware. Software, on the other hand, consists of the

  instructions that direct the hardware on what actions to perform, like a game,

  a word processor, or a screen reader. Continuing the kitchen analogy, a recipe

  for cookies serves as the software; it provides precise steps for the

  "hardware" (the person) to follow to achieve the desired outcome. Programs are

  sets of instructions written in a programming language, such as Python, that a

  computer can interpret and execute.


  For example, imagine a task like baking cookies. The oven, mixing bowls, and

  ingredients are comparable to computer hardware. The cookie recipe functions

  as the computer software, dictating the exact actions to perform with the

  hardware to achieve the desired result. Similarly, a screen reader, such as

  NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver, is a piece of software. It operates on the

  computer's hardware, including the processor and memory, to convert text into

  audible speech.


  ## Activities


  1. **Activity 1.1.1: "Human Computer" Role-Play**

     * Instructions: In pairs or small groups, one student assumes the role of the "computer" while the other acts as the "programmer." The programmer provides simple, precise, step-by-step instructions, a "program," for a common task, such as "make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich" or "walk to the door." The "computer" must follow only the instructions given, exactly as written, without making any assumptions.

     * Purpose: Illustrate the critical need for precise, unambiguous instructions in programming.

     * Accessibility: Fully verbal/conceptual.

  2. **Activity 1.1.2: Identify Hardware and Software**

     * Instructions: List five items you use daily. For each, identify whether it is hardware or software and explain your choice.

     * Purpose: Reinforce the distinction between hardware and software.

     * Accessibility: Type answers or discuss verbally.

        type: multiple
        content: Which of the following best describes the role of software in a
          computer system?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Software provides instructions for the hardware to perform specific
              tasks.
            explanation: Software consists of instructions that direct the hardware on what
              actions to perform.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Software is the physical component of a computer that can be touched.
            explanation: Hardware, not software, refers to the physical components of a
              computer.
          - id: "3"
            value: Software is a type of hardware that stores data.
            explanation: Software is not hardware; it is a set of instructions for the
              hardware.

        type: multiple
        content: Which of the following best illustrates the relationship between
          hardware and software using the kitchen analogy?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: The stove and refrigerator are hardware, while the cookie recipe is
              software.
            explanation: The stove and refrigerator represent physical components, while the
              recipe provides instructions.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: The cookie recipe is hardware, while the stove and refrigerator are
              software.
            explanation: The cookie recipe is not a physical component; it provides
              instructions, making it software.
          - id: "3"
            value: The mixing bowls and ingredients are software, while the cookie recipe is
              hardware.
            explanation: Mixing bowls and ingredients are physical components, not
              instructions, making them hardware.

        type: reflection
        content: Reflect on the kitchen analogy used to describe hardware and software.
          How does this analogy help you understand the relationship between
          hardware and software in a computer system? Can you think of another
          analogy that might help explain this concept to someone else?
