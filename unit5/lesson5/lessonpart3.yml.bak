  Lesson 4.5: Looping Through Dictionaries 
- Student Materials: 
	- Outline: 
		-  Iterating over a dictionary's keys using a for loop. 
		-  Using .values() to iterate only over the values. 
		-  Using .items() to iterate over both keys and values simultaneously (as a pair). 
		-  Understanding the order of items when iterating (typically insertion order in modern Python, but not guaranteed in older versions). 
	- Skills Checklist: 
		-  [ ] I can loop through all the keys in a dictionary. 
		-  [ ] I can loop through all the values in a dictionary. 
		-  [ ] I can loop through both the keys and values of a dictionary at the same time. 
		-  [ ] I can perform actions for each key, value, or key-value pair in a dictionary.
