- # Lesson: Looping Through Dictionaries


  ## Iterating through keys, values, and key-value pairs


  Use `for` loops to iterate through dictionaries.


  ## Explicit Examples


  ## Example 4.5.1: Iterating Through Keys, Values, and Items


  ```python

  inventory = {
     "apples": 50,
     "bananas": 30,
     "oranges": 40
  }


  print("--- Inventory Keys ---")

  for item_name in inventory:
     print(item_name)

  print("
- --- Inventory Values ---")

  for count in inventory.values():
     print(count)

  print("
- --- Inventory Items (Key-Value Pairs) ---")

  for item_name, count in inventory.items():
     print(f"{item_name}: {count} in stock")
  ```


  Expected Output:


  ```

  --- Inventory Keys ---

  apples

  bananas

  oranges


  --- Inventory Values ---

  50

  30

  40


  --- Inventory Items (Key-Value Pairs) ---

  apples: 50 in stock

  bananas: 30 in stock

  oranges: 40 in stock

  ```


  ## Activities


  1. **Activity 4.5.1: Favorite Languages Report**


  * Create `fav_languages.py`.


  * Create a dictionary of student names and favorite programming languages.

  language.


  * Loop through values to print all favorite languages.


  * (Challenge) Print a list of unique favorite languages.


  1. **Activity 4.5.2: Simple Inventory System**


  * Create `simple_inventory.py`.


  * Start with an inventory dictionary.


  * Print the current inventory.


  * Prompt the user for an item to "add" and the quantity. Update and print
  inventory.


  * Prompt for an item to "remove" and the quantity. Update and print inventory.
