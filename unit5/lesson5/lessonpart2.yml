  # Lesson: Looping Through Dictionaries


  ## Iterating through keys, values, and key-value pairs


  Use `for` loops to iterate through dictionaries.


  ## Explicit Examples


  ## Example 4.5.1: Iterating Through Keys, Values, and Items


  ```python


  inventory = {
     "apples": 50,
     "bananas": 30,
     "oranges": 40
  }



  print("--  - Inventory Keys ---")


  for item_name in inventory:
     print(item_name)

  print("

  - --  - Inventory Values ---")


  for count in inventory.values():
     print(count)

  print("

  - --  - Inventory Items (Key-Value Pairs) ---")


  for item_name, count in inventory.items():
     print(f"{item_name}: {count} in stock")
  ```


  Expected Output:


  ```


  --  - Inventory Keys ---


  apples


  bananas


  oranges



  --  - Inventory Values ---


  50


  30


  40



  --  - Inventory Items (Key-Value Pairs) ---


  apples: 50 in stock


  bananas: 30 in stock


  oranges: 40 in stock


  ```


  ## Activities


  1. **Activity 4.5.1: Favorite Languages Report**

     * Create `fav_languages.py`.

     * Create a dictionary of student names and favorite programming languages.

     * Loop through the dictionary to print each student's name and favorite
       language.

     * Loop through values to print all favorite languages.

     * (Challenge) Print a list of unique favorite languages.

  2. **Activity 4.5.2: Simple Inventory System**

     * Create `simple_inventory.py`.

     * Start with an inventory dictionary.

     * Print the current inventory.

     * Prompt the user for an item to "add" and the quantity. Update and print
       inventory.

     * Prompt for an item to "remove" and the quantity. Update and print inventory.

    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: multiple
        content: Which method would you use to iterate through both keys and values in a
          dictionary?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: .items()
            explanation: The .items() method returns key-value pairs, allowing iteration
              through both keys and values.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: .keys()
            explanation: The .keys() method only returns the keys of the dictionary.
          - id: "3"
            value: .values()
            explanation: The .values() method only returns the values of the dictionary.
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: multiple
        content: Which method would you use to iterate through only the values in a
          dictionary?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: .values()
            explanation: The .values() method is used to iterate through the values in a
              dictionary.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: .keys()
            explanation: The .keys() method is used to iterate through the keys in a
              dictionary.
          - id: "3"
            value: .items()
            explanation: The .items() method is used to iterate through key-value pairs in a
              dictionary.

    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: reflection
        content: Reflect on how using the .keys(), .values(), and .items() methods can
          help you efficiently manage and manipulate data in a dictionary. How
          might these methods be useful in a real-world application, such as
          managing an inventory system or tracking user preferences?
