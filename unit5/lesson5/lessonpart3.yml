  Lesson 4.5: Looping Through Dictionaries • Student Materials: ◦ Outline: ▪ Iterating over a dictionary's keys using a for loop. ▪ Using .values() to iterate only over the values. ▪ Using .items() to iterate over both keys and values simultaneously (as a pair). ▪ Understanding the order of items when iterating (typically insertion order in modern Python, but not guaranteed in older versions). ◦ Skills Checklist: ▪ [ ] I can loop through all the keys in a dictionary. ▪ [ ] I can loop through all the values in a dictionary. ▪ [ ] I can loop through both the keys and values of a dictionary at the same time. ▪ [ ] I can perform actions for each key, value, or key-value pair in a dictionary.
