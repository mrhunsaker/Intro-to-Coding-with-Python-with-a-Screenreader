  # Lesson: Introducing Dictionaries


  ## Creating, accessing, and modifying dictionaries


  Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces.


  ## Explicit Examples


  ## Example 4.4.1: Creating and Accessing a Dictionary


  ```python


  student_profile = {
     "name": "Emily",
     "age": 13,
     "grade": "7th",
     "favorite_subject": "Science"
  }


  print("Student Profile:", student_profile)


  print("Student's name:", student_profile["name"])


  print("Student's age:", student_profile["age"])


  ```


  Expected Output:


  ```


  Student Profile: {'name': 'Emily', 'age': 13, 'grade': '7th',

  'favorite_subject': 'Science'}


  Student's name: Emily


  Student's age: 13


  ```


  ## Example 4.4.2: Adding and Modifying Dictionary Entries


  ```python


  student_profile["city"] = "Springfield"


  print("After adding city:", student_profile)



  student_profile["favorite_subject"] = "Math"


  print("After changing subject:", student_profile)


  ```


  Expected Output:


  ```


  After adding city: {'name': 'Emily', 'age': 13, 'grade': '7th',

  'favorite_subject': 'Science', 'city': 'Springfield'}


  After changing subject: {'name': 'Emily', 'age': 13, 'grade': '7th',

  'favorite_subject': 'Math', 'city': 'Springfield'}


  ```


  ## Activities


  1. **Activity 4.4.1: Book Information Dictionary**

     * Create `book_info.py`.

     * Create a dictionary called `my_book` with keys: "title", "author",
       "publication\_year", "genre".

     * Print each piece of information.

     * Add a new entry for "number\_of\_pages". Print the updated dictionary.

     * Change the "genre". Print the dictionary again.

  2. **Activity 4.4.2: Simple Glossary**

     * Create `simple_glossary.py`.

     * Create a dictionary with five programming terms and definitions.

     * Print each term and its definition.

     * Prompt the user to enter a term. If found, print its definition; otherwise,
       print "Term not found."

        type: multiple
        content: What is the correct way to add a new key-value pair to an existing
          dictionary in Python?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Use the append() method with the key and value.
            explanation: The append() method is not used for dictionaries; it is used for
              lists.
          - id: "2"
            value: Assign a value to a new key using the dictionary's name and the key in
              square brackets.
            explanation: This is the correct way to add a new key-value pair to a
              dictionary.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "3"
            value: Use the add() method with the key and value.
            explanation: The add() method does not exist for dictionaries.
          - id: "4"
            value: Use the insert() method with the key and value.
            explanation: The insert() method is not applicable to dictionaries.

        type: multiple
        content: What is the correct way to modify the value of an existing key in a
          Python dictionary?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Use the assignment operator with the key, like `dictionary[key] =
              new_value`.
            explanation: This is the correct way to update the value of an existing key in a
              dictionary.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "Use the `update()` method with the key-value pair, like
              `dictionary.update({key: new_value})`."
            explanation: While `update()` can add or modify entries, using the assignment
              operator is more direct for modifying a single key.
          - id: "3"
            value: Use the `append()` method with the key-value pair.
            explanation: The `append()` method is not used with dictionaries; it is used
              with lists.

        type: reflection
        content: Reflect on how using dictionaries can help organize data in a program
          you are interested in creating. What are some potential key-value
          pairs you might use, and how would they enhance the functionality of
          your program?
