  # Lesson 4.3: Tuples: Immutable Lists 

  ## Student Materials: 
    - Outline: 
      -  Introduction to tuples: ordered collections similar to lists. 
      -  Defining tuples using parentheses (). 
      -  Key difference: tuples are immutable (cannot be changed after creation). 
      -  When to use tuples (for data that shouldn't change, like coordinates or fixed settings). 
      -  Accessing items in a tuple by index (same as lists). 
      -  Iterating over tuples with for loops. 
    - Skills Checklist: 
      -  [ ] I can create a tuple in Python. 
      -  [ ] I can explain the main difference between a list and a tuple (mutability). 
      -  [ ] I can identify appropriate situations for using a tuple. 
      -  [ ] I can access items in a tuple by their index. 
      -  [ ] I can iterate over a tuple using a for loop.
