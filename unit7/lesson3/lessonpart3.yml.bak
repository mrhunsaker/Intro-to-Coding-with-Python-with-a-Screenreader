  Lesson 6.3: Return Values
      • Student Materials:
          ◦ Outline:
              ▪ Understanding that functions can produce a result.
              ▪ The return statement: sending a value back from a function.
              ▪ Difference between print() (displays) and return (sends back for use).
              ▪ Storing returned values in variables.
              ▪ Functions that don't explicitly return a value implicitly return None.
          ◦ Skills Checklist:
              ▪ [ ] I can use the return statement to send a value back from a function.
              ▪ [ ] I can explain the difference between print() and return.
              ▪ [ ] I can store the returned value of a function in a variable.
