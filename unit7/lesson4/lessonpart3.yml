  # Lesson 6.4: Functions with Lists and Dictionaries 

  ## Student Materials: 
    - Outline: 
      -  Passing lists as arguments to functions. 
      -  Understanding that changes made to a list inside a function will affect the original list (because lists are mutable). 
      -  Passing dictionaries as arguments to functions. 
      -  Returning lists or dictionaries from functions. 
      -  Making a copy of a list (list[:]) or dictionary (dict.copy()) if you don't want the original to be modified.
