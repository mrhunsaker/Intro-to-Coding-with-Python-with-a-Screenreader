  Project overview: Accessible Personal Data Manager

  The student will build a simple application to manage a list of structured
  items. Example project types include:

  - Contact Manager: name, phone, email, notes
  - Book/Movie Tracker: title, author/director, genre, status (read/watched)
  - Simple To-Do List: task description, due date, status (pending/complete)
  - Simple Inventory: item name, quantity, location, notes

  The core functionality will include:

  1. Add new item: a form to input details for a new item.
  2. View all items: display items in a clear, accessible list format.
  3. Edit item: select an existing item and modify its details.
  4. Delete item: remove an item from the collection.
  5. Save/load data: persist the data to a JSON file.
