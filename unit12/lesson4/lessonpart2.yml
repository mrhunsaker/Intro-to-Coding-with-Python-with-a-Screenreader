  # Lesson: Displaying and Managing Items:


  * Concept: Dynamically updating GUI elements (e.g., a list of labels or
  cards). Identifying and selecting items for editing/deletion.


  * NiceGUI Approach: Using ui.column or ui.row with clear() and
  add\_card()/add\_label() in a loop to display items.


  * **Task 1: Implement the** **`update_item_logic()`** **function.**
    This function is called when the "Update Item" button is clicked.

    * Use the `selected_item_name` to find the item in your `all_items` list.

    * Update the item's attributes with the new values from the edit form's input fields (e.g., `selected_item.name = edit_name_input.value`).

    * After the update, call `update_item_display()` to refresh the GUI and `save_data()` to save the changes to the file.

  * **Task 2: Implement the** **`delete_selected_item_logic()`** **function.**
    This function is called when the "Delete Item" button is clicked.

    * Find the item to be deleted from the `all_items` list based on `selected_item_name`.

    * Remove the item from the list.

    * Call `update_item_display()` to remove the item from the GUI and `save_data()` to persist the deletion.

    * Remember to provide accessible feedback to the user via `ui.notify("Item deleted!", type='positive')`.
