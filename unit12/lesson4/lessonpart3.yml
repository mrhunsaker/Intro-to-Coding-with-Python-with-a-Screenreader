  ## Lesson 11.4: Displaying and Managing Items


-  Student Materials:

  -  Outline:

    -  Implementing the update_item_display() function:

      -  Clearing the existing display (items_display_column.clear()).
        Looping through the all_items list.
        For each item, dynamically creating ui.label or ui.card elements to display its attributes clearly.
        Populating the ui.select dropdown with options (e.g., item names) for selection.
        Ensuring the displayed information is easy for a screen reader to interpret (e.g., clear labels, grouping related info).
        Skills Checklist:
        [ ] I can dynamically update the GUI to display all items from the all_items list.
        [ ] I can clear existing GUI elements before re-rendering the list.
        [ ] I can display each item's details in a clear and structured way.
        [ ] I can populate the ui.select dropdown with the titles/names of existing items.
        [ ] I can ensure the displayed information is accessible and descriptive for a screen reader.
