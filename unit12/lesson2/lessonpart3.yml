  Lesson 11.2: Data Model and Storage
      • Student Materials:
          ◦ Outline:
              ▪ Designing the Python class (e.g., Contact, Book, Task) to represent a single item of data for the manager.
              ▪ Defining the attributes for this class (name, phone, email, etc.).
              ▪ Review of how to manage a collection of these items in Python (a list of objects or dictionaries).
              ▪ Implementing the load_data() function to read JSON data from data.json into the all_items list.
              ▪ Implementing the save_data() function to write the all_items list to data.json.
              ▪ Consideration of error handling for file operations (empty file, corrupted JSON).
          ◦ Skills Checklist:
              ▪ [ ] I can design a Python class or dictionary structure to represent a single data item for my manager.
              ▪ [ ] I can create a list to hold all instances of my data items.
              ▪ [ ] I can implement a function to load data from a data.json file.
              ▪ [ ] I can implement a function to save the current data to a data.json file.
              ▪ [ ] I can handle basic json.JSONDecodeError and FileNotFoundError during data loading/saving.
