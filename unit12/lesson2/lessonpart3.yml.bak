  Lesson 11.2: Data Model and Storage 
- Student Materials: 
	- Outline: 
		-  Designing the Python class (e.g., Contact, Book, Task) to represent a single item of data for the manager. 
		-  Defining the attributes for this class (name, phone, email, etc.). 
		-  Review of how to manage a collection of these items in Python (a list of objects or dictionaries). 
		-  Implementing the load_data() function to read JSON data from data.json into the all_items list. 
		-  Implementing the save_data() function to write the all_items list to data.json. 
		-  Consideration of error handling for file operations (empty file, corrupted JSON). 
	- Skills Checklist: 
		-  [ ] I can design a Python class or dictionary structure to represent a single data item for my manager. 
		-  [ ] I can create a list to hold all instances of my data items. 
		-  [ ] I can implement a function to load data from a data.json file. 
		-  [ ] I can implement a function to save the current data to a data.json file. 
		-  [ ] I can handle basic json.JSONDecodeError and FileNotFoundError during data loading/saving.
