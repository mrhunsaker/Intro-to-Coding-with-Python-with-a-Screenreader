  # Lesson: Implementing "Edit" and "Delete" Functionality:



  * Concept: Using the selected item's data to pre-populate edit forms. Removing

  items from the list.



  * **Task 1: Write the** **`README.md`** **file.**
    Your `README.md` is a critical deliverable. It should include:

    * Project Title and your name.

    * A brief description of your application's purpose.

    * Instructions on how to run your application.

    * Detailed instructions on how to use it with a screen reader. This is a chance to show your understanding of accessibility.

    * A thoughtful reflection on the challenges you faced and how you overcame them.

  * **Task 2: Review and Comment Your Code.**
    Read through your entire `app.py` file. Ensure your code is clean, well-indented, and uses meaningful variable and function names. Add comments where the logic is complex.

  * **Task 3: Prepare for the Demonstration.**
    Practice demonstrating your working application. You should be able to:

    * Add new items and see them appear in the list.

    * Select an existing item, edit its details, and update it.

    * Delete an item and see it disappear.

    * Use the `Load Data` and `Save Data` buttons to show persistence.

    * **Crucially**, be ready to perform all of these actions while a screen reader is active, explaining how the audio feedback corresponds to the actions on screen. This is the ultimate test of your accessibility focus.
