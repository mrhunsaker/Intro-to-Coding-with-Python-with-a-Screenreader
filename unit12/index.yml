title: "Unit 11: Capstone Project   - Accessible Personal Data Manager"
description: |
  Project Goal: Students will develop a fully functional,
  screen-reader-accessible graphical application that allows users to manage a
  collection of structured personal data (e.g., contacts, notes, simple
  inventory). The core GUI structure and initial accessibility features will be
  provided as a skeleton, and students will implement the underlying logic, data
  handling, and interaction.
  Framework Choice: NiceGUI is highly recommended over PySide6 for this capstone
  due to its simpler event-driven model, direct Python-to-web-frontend approach,
  and often better out-of-the-box accessibility with standard HTML elements.
  PySide6 offers more granular control but comes with a steeper learning curve
  for GUI layout and explicit accessibility considerations.
