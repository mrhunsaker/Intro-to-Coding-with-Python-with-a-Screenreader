title: "Unit 0: Setting Up Your Accessible Python Development Environment"
description: A detailed environment setup is not merely a technical
  prerequisite; it empowers students and reduces dependency on external
  assistance. For visually impaired students, relying on external help for every
  setup or environment issue can be disempowering and slow down the learning
  process. By providing extremely detailed, screen-reader-friendly instructions
  for environment setup, the curriculum proactively addresses a major potential
  bottleneck. This self-sufficiency fosters confidence and allows the student to
  concentrate on programming concepts rather than struggling with inaccessible
  tools or requiring constant sighted assistance for setup.

  - Set up Python and VS Code for accessible programming.
