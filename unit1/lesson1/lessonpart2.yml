  This lesson covers the initial software installation. Pay close attention to
  the instructions for your operating system.


  A. Installing Python 3


  Python is the programming language we will use. It's important to install
  Python 3.


  1. Open your web browser: Navigate to <https://www.python.org/downloads/>. 2.
  Locate the latest Python 3 release: The website usually prominently displays a
  button like "Download Python 3.x.x". Activate this link. 3. Run the Installer:
      - Windows:
        -  Locate the downloaded .exe file (usually in your Downloads folder). Activate it.
        -  CRUCIAL STEP: When the installer window appears, the very first thing you must do is check the "Add Python to PATH" checkbox. This is incredibly important for making Python accessible from your terminal later. Use Tab to navigate through the options until you hear this checkbox, and press Spacebar to check it.
        -  Then, navigate to "Install Now" (or "Customize installation" if you prefer to change the install location, but "Install Now" is fine for most) and activate it.
        -  Follow any further prompts. Once finished, activate "Close".
