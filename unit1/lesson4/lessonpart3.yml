  # Lesson 0.4: Python Environments and Terminal Usage 

  ## Student Materials: 

  - Outline: 
      -  How to create, save, and open a new Python file (.py). 
      -  Running a basic Python script (print("Hello!")) using the system terminal. 
      -  Running the same script using the integrated terminal within VS Code. 
      -  The concept of Python virtual environments: why they are important for project isolation. 
      -  Step-by-step instructions for creating a virtual environment using python3 -m venv .venv. 
      -  Instructions for activating the virtual environment on Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell) and macOS/Linux. 
      -  How to deactivate a virtual environment. 
      -  Crucially, how to "Select Interpreter" in VS Code to ensure it uses your virtual environment's Python. 
      -  Installing Python packages (libraries) like requests using pip within the active virtual environment. 
      -  Verifying installed packages using pip list. 
  - Skills Checklist:

      -  [ ] I can select the correct Python interpreter (my virtual environment) within VS Code. 
      -  [ ] I can install Python packages using pip into my active virtual environment. 
      -  [ ] I can list installed packages using pip list.
