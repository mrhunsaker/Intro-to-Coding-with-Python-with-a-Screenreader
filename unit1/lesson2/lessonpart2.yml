  # Lesson 0.2: Configuring Your Screen Reader for VS Code




  VS Code is highly accessible, but knowing specific screen reader commands and
  configuration tips will make a huge difference.


  A. General Screen Reader Tips for VS Code:


  1\. Use Screen Reader Mode:


  
	- VS Code Command: Press Ctrl + Shift + P to open the Command Palette. Type
  "Toggle Screen Reader Optimized" and press Enter.


  
	- What it does: This mode optimizes VS Code's UI for screen readers, disabling
  features that might interfere and enabling others that help. It should be on
  by default if a screen reader is detected. You can toggle it off and on to
  hear the difference.


  2\. Accessible View:


  
	- VS Code Command: Press Shift + Alt + F2 (Windows/Linux) or Shift + Option +
  F2 (macOS).


  
	- What it does: This opens a special pane that provides a flat, text-based
  representation of content that might otherwise be difficult for a screen
  reader to access (e.g., hover tooltips, complex UI elements, certain error
  messages). Use Esc to close it.


  3\. Keyboard-First Navigation:


  
	- VS Code is designed for keyboard navigation. Always prioritize keyboard
  shortcuts over mouse.


  
	- Tab and Shift+Tab: Use these to move focus between UI elements (sidebar,
  editor, panel, status bar).


  
	- Arrow Keys: Use within active panes (e.g., moving line by line in the
  editor, item by item in a list).


  4\. Listen to Status Bar: The status bar (at the very bottom of the VS Code
  window) provides crucial information: current line/column number, file type,
  active Python environment, error/warning counts. Learn to navigate to it
  (often Ctrl+1 or by tabbing from the editor) and quickly scan its contents.


  B. Screen Reader Specific Settings for Indentation:


  Python relies heavily on indentation. Your screen reader needs to clearly
  announce changes in indentation.


  1\. NVDA (Windows):


  
	- Open NVDA Menu: Press NVDA Key + N.


  
	- Preferences > Settings: Activate this.


  
	- Document Formatting: In the settings dialog, find and activate "Document
  Formatting" (you might type D to jump to it).


  
	- Indentation Reporting: Locate "Indentation" and set it to "Say all" or
  "Beeps". "Say all" is generally recommended as it announces the exact number
  of spaces/tabs.


  
	- Save: Activate "OK".


  
	- Verify: Open a Python file, create an indented block (like an if statement
  or a loop), and use arrow keys to move between indented and unindented lines.
  Listen for the indentation announcement.


  2\. JAWS (Windows):


  
	- Open JAWS Options: Press JAWS Key + J, then Alt+O for Options, then B for
  Basics.


  
	- Text Processing: Find "Text Processing" or similar.


  
	- Indentation Options: Look for options related to "Indent Detection" or
  "Announce Indents". Configure it to your preference (e.g., announce number of
  spaces).


  
	- Save: Activate "OK".


  3\. VoiceOver (macOS):


  
	- VoiceOver generally handles indentation well by default, often announcing "4
  spaces" or "tab" as you navigate.


  
	- VoiceOver Utility: You can fine-tune in VoiceOver Utility (Command + F5 to
  open, then VoiceOver Utility). Check "Verbosity" and "Text" settings, ensuring
  "Speak characters by type" or similar options are enabled.VS Code is highly
