  # Lesson: Iterating with for Loops

  ## Looping through sequences like strings and lists.

  A `for` loop repeats a block of code for each item in a sequence.

  ## Explicit Examples

  ## Example 3.4.1: Looping Through a List

  ```python
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  for fruit in fruits:
      print(f"I like {fruit}.")
  print("Finished listing fruits.")
  ```

  Expected Output:

  ```
  I like apple.
  I like banana.
  I like cherry.
  Finished listing fruits.
  ```

  ## Example 3.4.2: Looping Through a String

  ```python
  word = "Python"
  for char in word:
      print(char)
  ```

  Expected Output:

  ```
  P
  y
  t
  h
  o
  n
  ```

  ## Example 3.4.3: Using range() for Number Sequences

  ```python
  for i in range(5): # range(5) generates 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
      print(i)
  ```

  Expected Output:

  ```
  0
  1
  2
  3
  4
  ```

  ## Activities

  1. **Activity 3.4.1: My Favorite Things**

     1. Create `favorite_things.py`.

     2. Create a list of five favorite things.

     3. Use a for loop to print a sentence for each item.

     * Purpose: Practice iterating through a list.

  2. **Activity 3.4.2: Countdown Timer**

     1. Create `countdown.py`.

     2. Prompt for a starting number.

     3. Use a for loop with range() to count down to 1.

     4. Print "Blast off!" after the loop.

     * Purpose: Practice for loops with range().

  3. **Activity 3.4.3: Character by Character**

     1. Create `char_printer.py`.

     2. Prompt for a word or phrase.

     3. Use a for loop to print each character on a new line.

     * Purpose: Practice iterating through a string.

          - id: "1"
            value: To repeat a block of code for each item in a sequence.
            explanation: A for loop is used to iterate over sequences like lists and
              strings.

          - id: "2"
            value: To execute code only once.
            explanation: A for loop is used for iteration, not single execution.
          - id: "3"
            value: To handle errors in a program.
            explanation: Error handling is done using try-except blocks, not for loops.

        options:

            explanation: The range() function generates a sequence of numbers.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: list()
            explanation: The list() function creates a list, not a sequence of numbers.
          - id: "3"
            value: string()
            explanation: The string() function does not exist in Python for generating
              sequences.

          What will be the output of the following code snippet?

          ```python
          for i in range(3):
              print(f"Number: {i}")
          print("Loop complete.")
          ```

              Number: 0
              Number: 1
              Number: 2
              Loop complete.
            explanation: The range(3) generates numbers 0, 1, and 2, and the loop prints
              each number followed by 'Loop complete.'
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: |-
              Number: 1
              Number: 2
              Number: 3
              Loop complete.
            explanation: The range(3) starts from 0, not 1.
          - id: "3"
            value: |-
              Number: 0
              Number: 1
              Number: 2
            explanation: The loop is followed by a print statement that outputs 'Loop
              complete.'

            value: |-
              Number: 0

              Number: 2
              Number: 3
              Loop complete.
            explanation: The range(3) generates numbers up to 2, not 3.
