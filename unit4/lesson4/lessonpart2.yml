  # Lesson: Iterating with for Loops

  ## Looping through sequences like strings and lists.

  A `for` loop repeats a block of code for each item in a sequence.

  ## Explicit Examples

  ## Example 3.4.1: Looping Through a List

  ```python
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  for fruit in fruits:
      print(f"I like {fruit}.")
  print("Finished listing fruits.")
  ```

  Expected Output:

  ```
  I like apple.
  I like banana.
  I like cherry.
  Finished listing fruits.
  ```

  ## Example 3.4.2: Looping Through a String

  ```python
  word = "Python"
  for char in word:
      print(char)
  ```

  Expected Output:

  ```
  P
  y
  t
  h
  o
  n
  ```

  ## Example 3.4.3: Using range() for Number Sequences

  ```python
  for i in range(5): # range(5) generates 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
      print(i)
  ```

  Expected Output:

  ```
  0
  1
  2
  3
  4
  ```

  ## Activities

  1. **Activity 3.4.1: My Favorite Things**

     1. Create `favorite_things.py`.
     2. Create a list of five favorite things.
     3. Use a for loop to print a sentence for each item.

     * Purpose: Practice iterating through a list.

  2. **Activity 3.4.2: Countdown Timer**

     1. Create `countdown.py`.
     2. Prompt for a starting number.
     3. Use a for loop with range() to count down to 1.
     4. Print "Blast off!" after the loop.

     * Purpose: Practice for loops with range().

  3. **Activity 3.4.3: Character by Character**

     1. Create `char_printer.py`.
     2. Prompt for a word or phrase.
     3. Use a for loop to print each character on a new line.

     * Purpose: Practice iterating through a string.
