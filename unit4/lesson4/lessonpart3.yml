  - Lesson 3.4: Iterating with for Loops 
- Student Materials: 
	- Outline: 
		-  The concept of iteration: performing an action repeatedly for each item in a sequence. 
		-  The for loop: iterating over elements in a list or characters in a string. 
		-  The range() function for generating a sequence of numbers to loop a specific number of times. 
		-  Understanding the indentation of the code block under for. 
		-  Using the loop variable. 
	- Skills Checklist: 
		-  [ ] I can explain the purpose of a for loop. 
		-  [ ] I can write a for loop to iterate over items in a list. 
		-  [ ] I can write a for loop to iterate over characters in a string. 
		-  [ ] I can use the range() function to control how many times a loop runs. 
		-  [ ] I can correctly indent the code block belonging to a for loop.
