  expression (an expression that evaluates to True or False). ▪ The if
  statement: executing code only if a condition is True. ▪ Understanding the
  indentation of the code block under if. ◦ Skills Checklist: ▪ [ ] I can
  identify True and False as Boolean values. ▪ [ ] I can use comparison
  operators to create Boolean expressions. ▪ [ ] I can write a basic if
  statement. ▪ [ ] I can correctly indent the code block belonging to an if
  statement. ▪ [ ] I can predict whether an if block will execute based on its
  condition."
