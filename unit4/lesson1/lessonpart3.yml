  Lesson 3.1: Boolean Expressions and if Statements
      • Student Materials:
          ◦ Outline:
              ▪ Introduction to Boolean values: True and False.
              ▪ Comparison operators: == (equal to), != (not equal to), < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to).
              ▪ What is a Boolean expression (an expression that evaluates to True or False).
              ▪ The if statement: executing code only if a condition is True.
              ▪ Understanding the indentation of the code block under if.
          ◦ Skills Checklist:
              ▪ [ ] I can identify True and False as Boolean values.
              ▪ [ ] I can use comparison operators to create Boolean expressions.
              ▪ [ ] I can write a basic if statement.
              ▪ [ ] I can correctly indent the code block belonging to an if statement.
              ▪ [ ] I can predict whether an if block will execute based on its condition.
