  # Lesson: Chained Conditionals (elif, else)


  ## Handling multiple conditions.



  The `else` statement provides an alternative block of code to execute if the

  initial `if` condition evaluates to False. The `elif` (short for \"else if\")

  statement allows for checking multiple conditions in sequence. Only one code

  block\u2014the first one whose condition evaluates to True\u2014will be
  executed.



  ## Explicit Examples



  ## Example 3.2.1: Simple Grade Checker



  ```python


  score = 85


  if score >= 90:
      print(\"Grade: A\")
  elif score >= 80:
      print(\"Grade: B\")
  else:
      print(\"Grade: C or lower\")
  ```



  Expected Output:



  ```


  Grade: B


  ```



  ## Example 3.2.2: Stages of Life



  ```python


  age = 25


  if age < 2:
      print(\"You are a baby.\")
  elif age < 4:
      print(\"You are a toddler.\")
  elif age < 13:
      print(\"You are a kid.\")
  elif age < 20:
      print(\"You are a teenager.\")
  else:
      print(\"\
  You are an adult.\")

  ```



  Expected Output:



  ```


  You are an adult.


  ```



  ## Activities



  1. **Activity 3.2.1: Movie Ticket Pricing**


  1. Create `movie_tickets.py`.

  2. Prompt the user to enter their age.

  3. Implement ticket pricing rules using if-elif-else:

      * Age 0-5: Free

      * Age 6-12: $7

      * Age 13-64: $12

      * Age 65+: $5
  4. Print the calculated ticket price.


  * Purpose: Practice with chained conditionals.


  2. **Activity 3.2.2: Favorite Fruit Checker**


  1. Create `fruit_checker.py`.

  2. Prompt the user to enter their favorite fruit.

  3. Use if-elif-else to provide a specific response:

      * If \"apple\": print \"Apples are crisp and delicious!\"

      * If \"banana\": print \"Bananas are great for smoothies!\"

      * If \"orange\": print \"Oranges are full of Vitamin C!\"

      * Otherwise: print \"That's an interesting choice!\"
  4. Handle case sensitivity using `.lower()`.
