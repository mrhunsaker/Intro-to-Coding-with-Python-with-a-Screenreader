  # Lesson: Chained Conditionals (elif, else)


  ## Handling multiple conditions.


  The `else` statement provides an alternative block of code to execute if the

  initial `if` condition evaluates to False. The `elif` (short for "else if")

  statement allows for checking multiple conditions in sequence. Only one code

  blocku2014the first one whose condition evaluates to Trueu2014will be
  executed.


  ## Explicit Examples


  ## Example 3.2.1: Simple Grade Checker


  ```python


  score = 85


  if score >= 90:
      print("Grade: A")
  elif score >= 80:
      print("Grade: B")
  else:
      print("Grade: C or lower")
  ```


  Expected Output:


  ```


  Grade: B


  ```


  ## Example 3.2.2: Stages of Life


  ```python


  age = 25


  if age < 2:
      print("You are a baby.")
  elif age < 4:
      print("You are a toddler.")
  elif age < 13:
      print("You are a kid.")
  elif age < 20:
      print("You are a teenager.")
  else:
      print("
  You are an adult.")

  ```


  Expected Output:


  ```


  You are an adult.


  ```


  ## Activities


  1. **Activity 3.2.1: Movie Ticket Pricing**


  2. Create `movie_tickets.py`.


  3. Prompt the user to enter their age.


  4. Implement ticket pricing rules using if-elif-else:

     * Age 0-5: Free

     * Age 6-12: $7

     * Age 13-64: $12

     * Age 65+: $5

  5. Print the calculated ticket price.


  * Purpose: Practice with chained conditionals.


  1. **Activity 3.2.2: Favorite Fruit Checker**


  2. Create `fruit_checker.py`.


  3. Prompt the user to enter their favorite fruit.


  4. Use if-elif-else to provide a specific response:

     * If "apple": print "Apples are crisp and delicious!"

     * If "banana": print "Bananas are great for smoothies!"

     * If "orange": print "Oranges are full of Vitamin C!"

     * Otherwise: print "That's an interesting choice!"

  5. Handle case sensitivity using `.lower()`.


  * Purpose: Practice chained conditionals and string methods.

          decision-making in your programs. How do these constructs help in
          organizing your code, and what are some potential pitfalls to watch
          out for when using them?
