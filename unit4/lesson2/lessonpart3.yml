  # Lesson 3.2: Chained Conditionals (elif, else)


  ## Student Materials:



  - Outline:
    - The else statement: executing code if the if condition is False.
    - The elif statement: checking multiple conditions sequentially.
    - Understanding the order of if, elif, and else blocks.
    - Logical operators: and, or, not for combining Boolean expressions.
  - Skills Checklist:
    - [ ] I can use an else statement to provide an alternative path for an if condition.
    - [ ] I can use elif to check multiple conditions in order.
    - [ ] I can use the and operator to combine conditions where both must be true.
    - [ ] I can use the or operator to combine conditions where at least one must be true.
    - [ ] I can use the not operator to negate a Boolean expression.
    - [ ] I can write code that makes decisions based on multiple conditions.
