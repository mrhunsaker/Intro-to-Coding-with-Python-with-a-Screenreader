  Lesson 3.2: Chained Conditionals (elif, else)
    • Student Materials:
      ◦ Outline:
        ▪ The else statement: executing code if the if condition is False.
        ▪ The elif statement: checking multiple conditions sequentially.
        ▪ Understanding the order of if, elif, and else blocks.
        ▪ Logical operators: and, or, not for combining Boolean expressions.
      ◦ Skills Checklist:
        ▪ [ ] I can use an else statement to provide an alternative path for an if condition.
        ▪ [ ] I can use elif to check multiple conditions in order.
        ▪ [ ] I can use the and operator to combine conditions where both must be true.
        ▪ [ ] I can use the or operator to combine conditions where at least one must be true.
        ▪ [ ] I can use the not operator to negate a Boolean expression.
        ▪ [ ] I can write code that makes decisions based on multiple conditions.
