  # Lesson: Introduction to Lists


  ## Creating, accessing, and modifying lists.


  Lists in Python are ordered collections of items, enclosed in square brackets.
  Elements are accessed by their index (zero-indexed).


  ## Explicit Examples


  ## Example 3.3.1: Creating and Accessing a List


  ```python

  colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]

  print("My favorite colors are:", colors)

  print("The first color is:", colors[0])

  print("The third color is:", colors[2])

  ```


  Expected Output:


  ```

  My favorite colors are: ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow']

  The first color is: red

  The third color is: green

  ```


  ## Example 3.3.2: Modifying List Elements


  ```python

  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

  print("Original fruits:", fruits)

  fruits[1] = "grape" # Change 'banana' to 'grape'

  print("Modified fruits:", fruits)

  ```


  Expected Output:


  ```

  Original fruits: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

  Modified fruits: ['apple', 'grape', 'cherry']

  ```
