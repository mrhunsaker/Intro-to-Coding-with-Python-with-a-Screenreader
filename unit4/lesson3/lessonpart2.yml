  # Lesson: Introduction to Lists

  ## Creating, accessing, and modifying lists.

  Lists in Python are ordered collections of items, enclosed in square brackets.
  Elements are accessed by their index (zero-indexed).

  ## Explicit Examples

  ## Example 3.3.1: Creating and Accessing a List

  ```python

  colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]

  print("My favorite colors are:", colors)

  print("The first color is:", colors[0])

  print("The third color is:", colors[2])

  ```

  Expected Output:

  ```

  My favorite colors are: ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow']

  The first color is: red

  The third color is: green

  ```

  ## Example 3.3.2: Modifying List Elements

  ```python

  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

  print("Original fruits:", fruits)

  fruits[1] = "grape" # Change 'banana' to 'grape'

  print("Modified fruits:", fruits)

  ```

  Expected Output:

  ```

  Original fruits: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

  Modified fruits: ['apple', 'grape', 'cherry']

  ```

  ## Activities

  1. **Activity 3.3.1: My Top 3 Hobbies**

     1. Create `my_hobbies.py`.

     2. Create a list named hobbies with three favorite hobbies.

     3. Print the entire list.

     4. Print your second hobby.

     5. Change your third hobby and print the updated list.

     * Purpose: Practice list creation, indexing, and modification.

  2. **Activity 3.3.2: Guest List (Basic)**

     1. Create `guest_list.py`.

     2. Create a list of 3-4 people to invite to dinner.

     3. Print personalized invitations.

     4. Remove one guest and add a new one.

     5. Print new invitations.

     * Purpose: Practice managing collections with lists.

        content: What is the correct way to access the third element in a list named
          'colors' in Python?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: colors[2]
            explanation: In Python, lists are zero-indexed, so the third element is accessed
              with index 2.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: colors[3]
            explanation: Index 3 would access the fourth element, not the third.
          - id: "3"
            value: colors[1]
            explanation: Index 1 accesses the second element, not the third.
          - id: "4"
            value: colors[-1]
            explanation: Index -1 accesses the last element in the list.

          - id: "1"
            value: "['apple', 'grape', 'cherry']"
            explanation: The second element 'banana' is replaced with 'grape'.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']"
            explanation: The list is modified, so 'banana' is replaced with 'grape'.
          - id: "3"
            value: "['grape', 'banana', 'cherry']"
            explanation: Only the second element is changed, not the first.
          - id: "4"
            value: "['apple', 'cherry', 'grape']"
            explanation: The order of elements is not changed, only 'banana' is replaced
              with 'grape'.

          list to handle the data.
