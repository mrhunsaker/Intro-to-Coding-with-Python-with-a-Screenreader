  ## Lesson 8.1: Reading from a File
  - Student Materials:
    - Outline:
      - The concept of persistent storage: data remaining even after the program closes.
      - Opening a file for reading ("r" mode).
      - The with open(...) statement: ensures files are automatically closed.
      - Reading the entire content of a file (.read()).
      - Reading line by line (.readline(), or iterating directly over the file object).
      - Reading all lines into a list (.readlines()).
      - Removing newline characters (.strip()).
    - Skills Checklist:
      - [ ] I can explain why persistent storage is important.
      - [ ] I can open a file for reading using with open().
      - [ ] I can read the entire content of a file into a string.
