  - Lesson 8.1: Reading from a File 
- Student Materials: 
	- Outline: 
		-  The concept of persistent storage: data remaining even after the program closes. 
		-  Opening a file for reading ("r" mode). 
		-  The with open(...) statement: ensures files are automatically closed. 
		-  Reading the entire content of a file (.read()). 
		-  Reading line by line (.readline(), or iterating directly over the file object). 
		-  Reading all lines into a list (.readlines()). 
		-  Removing newline characters (.strip()). 
	- Skills Checklist: 
		-  [ ] I can explain why persistent storage is important. 
		-  [ ] I can open a file for reading using with open(). 
		-  [ ] I can read the entire content of a file into a string. 
		-  [ ] I can read a file line by line using a for loop. 
		-  [ ] I can remove leading/trailing whitespace, including newlines, from strings using .strip().
