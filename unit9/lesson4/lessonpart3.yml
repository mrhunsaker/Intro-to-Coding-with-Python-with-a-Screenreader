	#Lesson 8.4: The else Block and finally Block 
	##Student Materials: 
	- Outline: 
		-  The else block in try-except: executes only if no exception occurred in the try block. 
		-  The finally block in try-except: executes regardless of whether an exception occurred or not (useful for cleanup). 
	- Skills Checklist: 
		-  [ ] I can use an else block with try-except for code that runs only on success. 
		-  [ ] I can use a finally block with try-except for code that always runs.
