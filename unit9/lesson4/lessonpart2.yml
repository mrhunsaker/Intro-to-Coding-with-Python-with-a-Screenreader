- # Lesson: The else Block and finally Block

  ## Additional try-except clauses.

  ## Example 8.4.1: try-except-else for File Processing

  ```python
  filename = 'existing_file.txt'
  with open(filename, 'w') as f:
     f.write("This file exists.
- ")

  try:
     with open(filename, 'r') as file_object:
         contents = file_object.read()
  except FileNotFoundError:
     print(f"Sorry, the file {filename} was not found.")
  else:
     print(f"
- Successfully read {filename}:")
     print(contents)
  ```

  ## Example 8.4.2: try-except-finally for Cleanup

  ```python
  file_handle = None
  try:
     file_handle = open('another_file.txt', 'w')
     file_handle.write("Writing some data.
- ")
  except FileNotFoundError:
     print("Error: File path invalid.")
  except Exception as e:
     print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
  finally:
     if file_handle:
         file_handle.close()
         print("File closed in finally block.")
     else:
         print("File was not opened, so nothing to close.")
  print("Program finished.")
  ```

  ## Activities

  1. **Activity 8.4.1: User Login Simulation**

  * Create `login_sim.py`.

  * Use try-except-else for authentication.

  1. **Activity 8.4.2: Resource Cleanup**

  * Create `resource_cleanup.py`.

  * Simulate resource opening and cleanup with finally.
