  Lesson 8.5: Storing Data with JSON
      • Student Materials:
          ◦ Outline:
              ▪ Introduction to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as a common format for data exchange.
              ▪ JSON's relationship to Python dictionaries and lists.
                  • JSON Objects {} map to Python Dictionaries {}.
                  • JSON Arrays [] map to Python Lists [].
                  • JSON basic types (string, number, boolean, null) map to Python types.
              ▪ Using the json module:
                  • json.dump(data, file_object): Writes Python data to a JSON file.
                  • json.load(file_object): Reads JSON data from a file into Python.
              ▪ Saving and loading complex data structures (lists of dictionaries, etc.).
          ◦ Skills Checklist:
              ▪ [ ] I can explain what JSON is and why it's used.
              ▪ [ ] I can relate JSON objects and arrays to Python dictionaries and lists.
              ▪ [ ] I can use json.dump() to save Python data to a JSON file.
              ▪ [ ] I can use json.load() to load JSON data from a file into a Python object.
              ▪ [ ] I can save and load lists of dictionaries using JSON.
