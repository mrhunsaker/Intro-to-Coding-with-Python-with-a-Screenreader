  ## Example 10.2.1: Room Definition and Movement (Pseudocode)


  ```python

  room_descriptions = {
     "start_room": {
         "description": "You are in a dimly lit cave. There's a narrow passage to the NORTH.",
         "exits": {"north": "tunnel"}
     },
     "tunnel": {
         "description": "The tunnel is damp and cold. You can go SOUTH back to the cave or EAST to a clearing.",
         "exits": {"south": "start_room", "east": "clearing"}
     },
     "clearing": {
         "description": "You've reached a small, sunny clearing. A faint path leads WEST.",
         "exits": {"west": "tunnel"}
     }
  }


  current_room = "start_room"


  while True:
     print("
- " + room_descriptions[current_room]["description"])
     command = input("What do you want to do? ").lower()

     if command in room_descriptions[current_room]["exits"]:
         current_room = room_descriptions[current_room]["exits"][command]
     elif command == "quit":
         print("Exiting game. Goodbye!")
         break
     else:
         print("I don't understand that command or you can't go that way.")
  ```
