- Student Materials: 
	- Outline: 
		-  The importance of project planning before coding. 
		-  Breaking down a large problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems (modules, functions, classes). 
		-  Defining project features and user interactions. 
		-  Planning data structures (which lists, dictionaries, or classes will be needed). 
		-  Designing the overall program flow. 
		-  Thinking about accessible input/output design for screen readers. 
	- Skills Checklist: 
		-  [ ] I can break down a larger problem into smaller, manageable parts. 
		-  [ ] I can identify the key features required for a project. 
		-  [ ] I can plan which data structures will be most suitable for my project's data. 
		-  [ ] I can outline the main steps or flow of my program. 
		-  [ ] I can consider user interaction and feedback during the design phase.
