  # Lesson: Building a Text-Based Adventure Game (Part 2)


  ## Adding items, puzzles, and game state management.


  ## Example 10.3.1: Item and Puzzle Integration (Pseudocode)


  ```python


  - room_descriptions = { "start_room": { "description": "You are in a dimly lit
  cave. There's a narrow passage to the NORTH. You see a SHINY KEY on the
  ground.", "exits": {"north": "locked_door_room"}, "items": ["shiny key"] },
  "locked_door_room": { "description": "You are in a small chamber with a heavy
  wooden door to the NORTH. It's locked.", "exits": {"south": "start_room"},
  "items": [] } }


  - current_room = "start_room"


  - player_inventory = []


  - door_locked = True


  - while True: print("\n" + room_descriptions[current_room]["description"]) if
  room_descriptions[current_room]["items"]: print(f"You see: {',
  '.join(room_descriptions[current_room]['items'])}") print(f"Your inventory:
  {', '.join(player_inventory) if player_inventory else 'empty'}")


  - command = input("What do you want to do? ").lower()


  - if command == "take shiny key" and "shiny key" in
  room_descriptions[current_room]["items"]: player_inventory.append("shiny key")
  room_descriptions[current_room]["items"].remove("shiny key") print("You picked
  up the shiny key.") elif command == "use shiny key" and current_room ==
  "locked_door_room" and "shiny key" in player_inventory and door_locked:
  door_locked = False print("You unlocked the door!")
  room_descriptions["locked_door_room"]["description"] = "You are in a small
  chamber with a heavy wooden door to the NORTH. It's now unlocked!"
  room_descriptions["locked_door_room"]["exits"]["north"] = "treasure_room" elif
  command in room_descriptions[current_room]["exits"]: if command == "north" and
  current_room == "locked_door_room" and door_locked: print("The door is locked!
  You need a key.") else: current_room =
  room_descriptions[current_room]["exits"][command] elif command == "quit":
  print("Exiting game. Goodbye!") break else: print("I don't understand that
  command or you can't go that way.") ```
