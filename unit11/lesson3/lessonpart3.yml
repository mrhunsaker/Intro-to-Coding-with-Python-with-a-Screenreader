  ## Adding items, puzzles, and game state management.
  
  ## Example 10.3.1: Item and Puzzle Integration (Pseudocode)
  
  ```python
  
  - room_descriptions = { "start_room": { "description": "You are in a dimly lit cave. There's a narrow passage to the NORTH. You see a SHINY KEY on the ground.", "exits": {"north": "locked_door_room"}, "items": ["shiny key"] }, "locked_door_room": { "description": "You are in a small chamber with a heavy wooden door to the NORTH. It's locked.", "exits": {"south": "start_room"}, "items": [] } }
  
  - current_room = "start_room"
  
  - player_inventory = []
  
  - door_locked = True
  
  - while True: print("\n" + room_descriptions[current_room]["description"]) if room_descriptions[current_room]["items"]: print(f"You see: {', '.join(room_descriptions[current_room]['items'])}") print(f"Your inventory: {', '.join(player_inventory) if player_inventory else 'empty'}")
  
  - command = input("What do you want to do? ").lower()
  
  - if command == "take shiny key" and "shiny key" in room_descriptions[current_room]["items"]: player_inventory.append("shiny key") room_descriptions[current_room]["items"].remove("shiny key") print("You picked up the shiny key.") elif command == "use shiny key" and current_room == "locked_door_room" and "shiny key" in player_inventory and door_locked: door_locked = False print("You unlocked the door!") room_descriptions["locked_door_room"]["description"] = "You are in a small chamber with a heavy wooden door to the NORTH. It's now unlocked!" room_descriptions["locked_door_room"]["exits"]["north"] = "treasure_room" elif command in room_descriptions[current_room]["exits"]: if command == "north" and current_room == "locked_door_room" and door_locked: print("The door is locked! You need a key.") else: current_room = room_descriptions[current_room]["exits"][command] elif command == "quit": print("Exiting game. Goodbye!") break else: print("I don't understand that command or you can't go that way.") ```
