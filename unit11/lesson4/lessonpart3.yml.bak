  Lesson 10.4: Developing a Command-Line Tool 
- Student Materials: 
	- Outline: 
		-  Choosing a simple, useful utility to build (e.g., a simple to-do list manager, a contact book).

		-  Saving and loading data to/from a file (JSON or plain text) for persistence. 
	- Skills Checklist: 
		-  [ ] I can choose and define the scope of a simple command-line utility. 
		-  [ ] I can design an interactive menu system for a tool. 
		-  [ ] I can use a while loop to maintain continuous user interaction.
