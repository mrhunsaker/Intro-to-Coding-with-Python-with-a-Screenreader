  ## Independent Practice:


  1. Multiple Choice: What is the main benefit of using functions in
  programming?

     * a) They make programs run faster.

     * b) They allow code to be reused and organized.

     * c) They automatically fix errors.

     * d) They eliminate the need for variables.

  2. True/False: A function can accept arguments but cannot return a value.


  3. Yes/No: When you call a function, do the arguments you pass always have to
  be in the exact same order as the parameters defined in the function?


  4. Multiple Choice: What keyword is used to define a function in Python?

     * a) function

     * b) define

     * c) fun

     * d) def

  5. True/False: Variables defined inside a function are generally only
  accessible within that function.


  ## Potential Assessment Questions:


  1. Multiple Choice: Consider the function:

     ```python
     def greet(name):
         return "Hello, " + name + "!"
     ```

     What will `print(greet("Eve"))` output?

     * a) greet("Eve")

     * b) Hello, Eve!

     * c) Hello, name!

     * d) Error

  2. True/False: A function can have multiple return statements, but only one
  will be executed when the function is called.


  3. Yes/No: Can you pass a list as an argument to a function?


  4. Multiple Choice: What is the purpose of the return statement in a function?

     * a) To print a message to the console.

     * b) To stop the execution of the program.

     * c) To send a value back to the caller of the function.

     * d) To define a new variable.
