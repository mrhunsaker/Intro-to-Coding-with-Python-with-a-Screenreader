  ## Unit 4: Data Structures: Lists and Dictionaries


  ### Independent Practice:


  1. Multiple Choice: Which method would you use to add an element to the end of
  an existing list?

     * a) insert()

     * b) remove()

     * c) append()

     * d) pop()

  2. True/False: Once a list is created, its elements cannot be changed or
  reordered.


  3. Yes/No: Is `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)` an example of an immutable data
  structure?


  4. Multiple Choice: Which of the following best describes a dictionary in
  Python?

     * a) An ordered collection of items, accessed by index.

     * b) An unordered collection of items stored as key-value pairs.

     * c) A fixed-size collection of numeric data.

     * d) A way to store multiple lines of text.

  5. True/False: You can access a value in a dictionary using its key, like
  `my_dict["key_name"]`.


  ### Potential Assessment Questions:


  1. Multiple Choice: If `data = [1, 2, 3]` and you execute `data.pop()`, what
  will `data` be afterwards?

     * a) \[1, 2, 3]

     * b) \[1, 2]

     * c) \[3]

     * d) \[2, 3]

  2. True/False: The `sorted()` function modifies the original list in place.


  3. Yes/No: Can a dictionary have duplicate keys?


  4. Multiple Choice: Given `person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}`, how would you
  get the value associated with the key "name"?

     * a) person.name

     * b) person\[0]

     * c) person\["name"]

     * d) person.get(0)
