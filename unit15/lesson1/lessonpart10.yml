- # Unit 10: Project-Based Learning: Building Text-Based Applications


  (Note: These questions are more conceptual and design-focused, as the primary
  assessment here is the project itself.)


  ## Independent Practice:


  1. Multiple Choice: When designing a text-based adventure game, what would be
  a good approach to represent different locations the player can visit?

     * a) A single long string variable.

     * b) A separate variable for each room.

     * c) A class for Room objects, each with descriptions and exits.

     * d) A list of numbers.

  2. True/False: Modular programming encourages breaking down a large problem
  into smaller, manageable pieces (like functions or classes).


  3. Yes/No: For a command-line tool that stores user data, is it important to
  consider how that data will be saved and loaded between program runs?


  4. Multiple Choice: In a text-based application, what is the best way to
  ensure clarity for a screen reader user when asking for input?

     * a) Just wait for input without any prompt.

     * b) Provide a very short, cryptic prompt.

     * c) Provide clear, descriptive prompts that explain what input is expected.

     * d) Play a loud sound every time input is needed.

  5. True/False: A well-designed text-based application should provide clear
  feedback to the user after they perform an action.


  ## Potential Assessment Questions:


  1. Multiple Choice: You are building a to-do list application. Which Python
  concept would be most appropriate for representing each individual task (e.g.,
  its description, due date, completion status)?

     * a) A simple string.

     * b) A single integer.

     * c) A dictionary or a custom class (e.g., Task).

     * d) A random number.

  2. True/False: When developing a large project, it's generally best to write
  all the code at once without testing until the very end.


  3. Yes/No: Could you use a while loop to manage the main game loop of a
  text-based adventure game, continuously taking player commands until the game
  ends?


  4. Multiple Choice: If your text-based application needs to store a list of
  items and their current quantities, which data structure would be most
  efficient?

     * a) A list of strings.

     * b) A tuple of numbers.

     * c) A dictionary where keys are item names and values are quantities.

     * d) A set of item names.
