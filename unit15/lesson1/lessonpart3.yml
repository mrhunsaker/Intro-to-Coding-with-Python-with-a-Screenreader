  ## Independent Practice:


  1. Multiple Choice: Which operator is used for checking if two values are
  equal in Python?

     * a) =

     * b) ==

     * c) !=

     * d) <

  2. True/False: If an if condition is True, the code block under its
  corresponding else statement will also execute.


  3. Yes/No: Can a for loop iterate over each character in a string?


  4. Multiple Choice: What will `len("Python")` return?

     * a) 7

     * b) 6

     * c) 5

     * d) Error

  5. True/False: The elif keyword is used when you have multiple conditions to
  check sequentially.


  ## Potential Assessment Questions:


  1. Multiple Choice: Consider the code:

     ```python
     age = 15
     if age >= 18:
         print("Adult")
     else:
         print("Minor")
     ```

     What will be printed?

     * a) Adult

     * b) Minor

     * c) Nothing

     * d) Error

  2. True/False: After executing `my_list = [10, 20, 30]`, `my_list[1]` refers
  to the value 10.


  3. Yes/No: Can you use `for i in range(5):` to loop exactly 5 times?


  4. Multiple Choice: Which of the following will correctly convert a string `s
  = "Hello"` to all lowercase?

     * a) `s.lowercase()`

     * b) `s.lower()`

     * c) `lower(s)`

     * d) `s.to_lower()`
