  # Unit 2: Writing Simple Programs and Numeric Computations


  ## Independent Practice:


  1. Multiple Choice: In the software development process, which phase typically
  comes after designing the solution?

     * a) Testing

     * b) Problem Solving

     * c) Implementation (coding)

     * d) Maintenance

  2. True/False: The input() function in Python always returns data as a string,
  even if the user types a number.


  3. Yes/No: If you want to perform multiplication with numbers stored as
  strings, do you need to convert them to numeric types first?


  4. Multiple Choice: What is the result of 10 / 3 in Python 3?

     * a) 3

     * b) 3.3333333333333335

     * c) 3.0

     * d) Error

  5. True/False: int(5.9) will result in 6.


  ## Potential Assessment Questions:


  1. Multiple Choice: You are writing a program to calculate the area of a
  circle. Which step is part of the design phase?

     * a) Typing radius = input("Enter radius: ")

     * b) Deciding to use the formula Area = pi \* radius^2

     * c) Running the program to see if it works.

     * d) Fixing a typo in the print statement.

  2. True/False: float("3.14") successfully converts the string "3.14" into a
  floating-point number.


  3. Yes/No: Can you directly use math.sqrt() without importing the math module?


  4. Multiple Choice: If x = 5 and y = 2, what is the value of x // y?

     * a) 2.5

     * b) 2

     * c) 3

     * d) Error
