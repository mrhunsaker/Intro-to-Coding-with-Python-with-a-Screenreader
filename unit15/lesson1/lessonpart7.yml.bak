  ## Independent Practice:


  1. Multiple Choice: Which of the following best describes an object in
  Object-Oriented Programming?

     * a) A blueprint for creating data.

     * b) An instance of a class.

     * c) A function that performs a task.

     * d) A type of variable.

  2. True/False: The `__init__` method in a class is automatically called when a
  new object of that class is created.


  3. Yes/No: Can an object have multiple attributes?


  4. Multiple Choice: What is a method in the context of a class?

     * a) A variable that stores data.

     * b) A special type of function that belongs to a class.

     * c) An error message.

     * d) The name of the class.

  5. True/False: Inheritance allows a new class to reuse and extend the
  functionality of an existing class.


  ## Potential Assessment Questions:


  1. Multiple Choice: If you have a class `Dog` and create an object `my_dog =
  Dog()`, what is `my_dog`?

     * a) A class.

     * b) A method.

     * c) An instance (object) of the Dog class.

     * d) An attribute.

  2. True/False: All attributes of a class must be defined within the `__init__`
  method.


  3. Yes/No: Can a child class (subclass) override a method defined in its
  parent class (superclass)?


  4. Multiple Choice: Which concept describes the bundling of data (attributes)
  and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (an object)?

     * a) Inheritance

     * b) Polymorphism

     * c) Encapsulation

     * d) Abstraction
