  # Unit 9: Testing Your Code and Introduction to Data Analysis

  ## Independent Practice:
      1. Multiple Choice: What is the primary goal of unit testing? a) To make your code longer. b) To verify that individual parts (units) of a program work correctly. c) To create visual charts of data. d) To hide errors from the user.
      2. True/False: The unittest module is a built-in Python library for writing tests.
      3. Yes/No: Does random.randint(1, 5) generate a random integer that includes both 1 and 5?
      4. Multiple Choice: If you are counting the occurrences of words in a large text file, which Python data structure would be most suitable to store the word counts? a) A list b) A tuple c) A dictionary d) A set
      5. True/False: Analyzing text data often involves counting characters, words, or specific phrases.
  ## Potential Assessment Questions:
      1. Multiple Choice: You have a function add_numbers(a, b) that should return the sum of a and b. Which assertion would you use in a unittest to check if add_numbers(2, 3) returns 5? a) self.assertFalse(add_numbers(2, 3) == 5) b) self.assertEqual(add_numbers(2, 3), 5) c) self.assertTrue(add_numbers(2, 3) != 5) d) self.assertNotEqual(add_numbers(2, 3), 5)
      2. True/False: To test a class, you typically create an instance of the class in your test method and then call its methods.
      3. Yes/No: If a test case fails, does it necessarily mean the entire program is broken?
      4. Multiple Choice: When reading data from a CSV file (Comma Separated Values), how are individual values typically separated from each other on a line? a) Semicolons (;) b) Tabs (\t) c) Commas (,) d) Spaces ( )
