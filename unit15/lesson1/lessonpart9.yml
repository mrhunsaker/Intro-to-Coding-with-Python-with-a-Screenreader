  # Unit 9: Testing Your Code and Introduction to Data Analysis



  ## Independent Practice:



  1. Multiple Choice: What is the primary goal of unit testing?&#x20;

     * a) To make your code longer.&#x20;

     * b) To verify that individual parts (units) of a program work correctly.&#x20;

     * c) To create visual charts of data.&#x20;

     * d) To hide errors from the user.
  2. True/False: The unittest module is a built-in Python library for writing

  tests.


  3. Yes/No: Does random.randint(1, 5) generate a random integer that includes

  both 1 and 5?


  4. Multiple Choice: If you are counting the occurrences of words in a large

  text file, which Python data structure would be most suitable to store the

  word counts?&#x20;

     * a) A list&#x20;

     * b) A tuple&#x20;

     * c) A dictionary&#x20;

     * d) A set
  5. True/False: Analyzing text data often involves counting characters, words,

  or specific phrases.



  ## Potential Assessment Questions:



  1. Multiple Choice: You have a function add_numbers(a, b) that should return

  the sum of a and b. Which assertion would you use in a unittest to check if

  add_numbers(2, 3) returns 5?&#x20;

     * a) self.assertFalse(add_numbers(2, 3) == 5)&#x20;

     * b) self.assertEqual(add_numbers(2, 3), 5)&#x20;

     * c) self.assertTrue(add_numbers(2, 3) != 5)&#x20;

     * d) self.assertNotEqual(add_numbers(2, 3), 5)
  2. True/False: To test a class, you typically create an instance of the class

  in your test method and then call its methods.


  3. Yes/No: If a test case fails, does it necessarily mean the entire program

  is broken?


  4. Multiple Choice: When reading data from a CSV file (Comma Separated

  Values), how are individual values typically separated from each other on a

  line?&#x20;

     * a) Semicolons (;)&#x20;

     * b) Tabs ()&#x20;

     * c) Commas (,)&#x20;

     * d) Spaces ( )
