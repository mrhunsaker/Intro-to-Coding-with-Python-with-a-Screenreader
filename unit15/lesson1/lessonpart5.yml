  # Unit 5: User Input and While Loops
  ## Independent Practice:


  1. Multiple Choice: If you want a program to repeatedly ask for user input
  until a specific keyword is entered, which type of loop is most appropriate?\
     a) for loop\
     b) while loop\
     c) if-else statement\
     d) try-except block

  2. True/False: A `while True:` loop will run indefinitely unless a break
  statement is encountered.


  3. Yes/No: Does the continue statement cause a loop to exit entirely?


  4. Multiple Choice: What is the primary purpose of a "flag" in a while loop?\
     a) To display an image.\
     b) To store a boolean value that controls loop termination.\
     c) To highlight syntax errors.\
     d) To make the loop run faster.

  5. True/False: The `input()` function can cause an infinite loop if not used
  carefully within a while loop.


  ## Potential Assessment Questions:


  1. Multiple Choice: Consider the code:

     ```python
     count = 0
     while count < 3:
         print(count)
         count += 1
     ```

     What will be printed?\
     a) 0 1 2 (each on a new line)\
     b) 0 1 2 3 (each on a new line)\
     c) Nothing (infinite loop)\
     d) Error

  2. True/False: If you type "5" at an `input()` prompt, the program receives
  the integer 5.


  3. Yes/No: Can a while loop be used to iterate over items in a list, similar
  to a for loop?


  4. Multiple Choice: Which statement will immediately exit the current
  iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration?\
     a) break\
     b) exit()\
     c) continue\
     d) return
