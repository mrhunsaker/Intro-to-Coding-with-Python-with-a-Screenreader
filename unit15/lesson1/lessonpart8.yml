  ## Unit 8: Files and Exceptions


  ### Independent Practice:


  1. Multiple Choice: Which mode would you use to open a file if you want to add
  new content to the end of it without erasing existing content?

     * a) r (read)

     * b) w (write)

     * c) a (append)

     * d) x (exclusive creation)

  2. True/False: It's good practice to close a file after you've finished
  working with it.


  3. Yes/No: Will the following code cause an error if `my_file.txt` does not
  exist: `with open('my_file.txt', 'r') as f: pass`?


  4. Multiple Choice: What is the purpose of a try-except block?

     * a) To make a program run faster.

     * b) To define a new function.

     * c) To handle errors gracefully and prevent program crashes.

     * d) To write data to a file.

  5. True/False: A ZeroDivisionError occurs when you try to divide a number by
  zero.


  ### Potential Assessment Questions:


  1. Multiple Choice: What will happen if you open a file in 'w' mode and then
  write to it, and the file already contains data?

     * a) The new data will be appended to the end.

     * b) The existing data will be overwritten (erased).

     * c) An error will occur.

     * d) The new data will be inserted at the beginning.

  2. True/False: `json.dump()` is used to read data from a JSON file into a
  Python object.


  3. Yes/No: Can you have multiple except blocks to handle different types of
  errors in a single try statement?


  4. Multiple Choice: Consider the code:

     ```python
     try:
         result = int("abc") / 2
     except ValueError:
         print("Invalid number")
     except ZeroDivisionError:
         print("Cannot divide by zero")
     ```

     What will be printed?

     * a) Invalid number

     * b) Cannot divide by zero

     * c) Nothing (error still occurs)

     * d) 0
