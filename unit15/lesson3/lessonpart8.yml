  # Unit 7: Classes and Object-Oriented Programming


  ## Emphasis/Resources:


  * Analogy: Use real-world analogies for classes and objects (e.g., "cookie
  cutter" for class, "cookies" for objects; "car blueprint" for class,
  "individual cars" for objects).

    * self parameter: Explain self as the reference to the current instance of the object.

    * Method Calls: Differentiate between calling a function and calling a method on an object.

  ## Challenge Projects:


  1. "The Uninitialized Object":

     * Scenario: You created a class for a Pet, but when you try to create a pet, you get an error because the attributes aren't set up.

     * Code (missing __init__ implementation):

  ```python

  class Pet:
      # Missing __init__ method

      def make_sound(self):
          print(f"{self.name} makes a sound.")

  my_pet = Pet("Fido", "Dog") # Error here

  my_pet.make_sound()

  ```


  * Task: Add an __init__ method to the Pet class that takes name and species as
  parameters and assigns them to instance attributes.


  2\. "The Attribute Assignment Error":

  \- Scenario: You're trying to update an object's attribute, but it's not
  working as expected.

  \- Code (incorrect attribute update):


  ```python

  class Car:
      def __init__(self, make, model):
          self.make = make
          self.model = model
          self.speed = 0

      def accelerate(self, amount):
          speed += amount # Missing 'self.'

  my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry")

  my_car.accelerate(50)

  print(my_car.speed) # Will print 0

  ```


  * Task: Fix the accelerate method so that it correctly updates
