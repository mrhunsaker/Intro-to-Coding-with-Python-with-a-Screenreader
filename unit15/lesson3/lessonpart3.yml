  # Unit 2: Writing Simple Programs and Numeric Computations
  ## Emphasis/Resources:
    
  -  Type Conversion Clarity: Re-emphasize why input() returns strings and why
  int() or float() are necessary for calculations. Use analogies like converting
  "five" (word) to 5 (number).
  -  Order of Operations: Review PEMDAS/BODMAS.
  
  ## Challenge Projects:
  
  1. "The Mixed-Up Calculator":
     -  Scenario: You wanted to create a simple calculator, but some inputs are not being treated as numbers, leading to unexpected results.
     -  Code (with errors):
  
  ```python  
  num1_str = input("Enter first number: ")
  num2_str = input("Enter second number: ")
  sum_result = num1_str + num2_str
  print("Sum:", sum_result)
  product_result = int(num1_str) * int(num2_str)  # One part of the issue
  print("Product:", product_result)
  ```
    
  -  Task: Correct the code so that the sum and product are calculated
  numerically. Users should be able to enter 5 and 10 and get 15 and 50.
