  # Unit 1: Foundations of Computing and Getting Started with Python


  ## Emphasis/Resources:


  * Console Output: Practice distinguishing between program output and
  interpreter feedback.


  * Reading print() output: Have them write multiple print() statements and
  predict the output order.


  ## Challenge Projects:


  1. "The Jumbled Greeting":

     * Scenario: You were trying to print a simple greeting, but accidentally introduced some common typos.

     * Code (with errors):

  ```python

  prin("Hello, World"

  print "My name is"

  print(42)  # This one is correct

  print("Nice to meet you!)"

  ```


  * Task: Identify and fix all the errors so the program runs correctly,
  printing each statement on a new line. Focus on listening to error messages.
