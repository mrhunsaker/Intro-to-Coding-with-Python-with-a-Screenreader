  # Unit 4: Data Structures: Lists and Dictionaries



  ## Emphasis/Resources:



  -  List vs. Tuple vs. Dictionary: Create a table comparing their properties

  (ordered/unordered, mutable/immutable, indexed/keyed).



  -  Nested Data Structures: Explain how lists can contain dictionaries, and

  dictionaries can contain lists (e.g., a list of contacts, where each contact

  is a dictionary). This prepares them for JSON.



  ## Challenge Projects:



  1. "The Missing Dictionary Key":

     -  Scenario: You're trying to access information from a dictionary, but you keep getting a KeyError.

     -  Code (with common dictionary error):

  ```python


  student = {
      "name": "Alice",
      "grade": "A",
      "age": 16
  }


  print(student["Name"]) # Incorrect key casing


  ```



  -  Task: Fix the code to correctly print "Alice".



  2. "The List Manipulation Mishap":

    - Scenario: You wanted to add an item to a list and then sort it, but
  something went wrong.

    - Code (with common list method mistake):


  ```python


  my_fruits = ["apple", "banana"]


  my_fruits.sort("orange") # Incorrect usage of sort()


  print(my_fruits)


  ```



  -  Task: Fix the code so that "orange" is added to the list, and then the list

  is sorted alphabetically.
