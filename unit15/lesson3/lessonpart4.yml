  # Unit 3: Control Flow: Decisions and Loops

  ## Emphasis/Resources:
      • Indentation Strategy for Loops/Conditionals: This is CRITICAL.
          ◦ Verbalizing Indentation: Teach students to mentally (or verbally) say "indent level 1," "indent level 2" as they navigate.
          ◦ Block Markers (Optional but helpful): Introduce the idea of using comments to visually (or audibly) mark blocks, especially for longer ones.
  ```python

  if condition:
      # #start_if_block
      # ... indented code ...
      # #end_if_block
  Or just for loops:

  for item in my_list:
      # #loop_start
      # ...
      # #loop_end
  ```
          ◦ VS Code Indent Guides: Remind them of the "indent guide" lines for visual users, but for screen reader users, the "indent beep/announce" is the real tool.
      • Boolean Logic: Walk through truth tables for and, or, not.
  ## Challenge Projects:
      1. "The Indentation Maze - Conditional Chaos":
          ◦ Scenario: You were writing a program to check user age and access rights, but copied some code incorrectly, messing up the indentation. The program isn't behaving as expected.
          ◦ Code (with subtle indentation errors):
  ```python

  age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

  has_id = input("Do you have ID? (yes/no): ").lower()


  if age >= 18:

  if has_id == "yes": # This line is incorrectly indented
      print("Access granted!")
      print("Welcome.")
  else:
      print("Access denied: No ID.")
  else:
      print("Access denied: Too young.")
  ```
          ◦ Task: Fix the indentation so that "Welcome." is only printed when age >= 18 AND has_id == "yes". Test with different age/ID combinations.
      2. "The Looping Labyrinth - For Loop Fix":
          ◦ Scenario: You tried to print numbers from 1 to 5, but the loop isn't working right because of indentation.
          ◦ Code (with errors):
  ```python

  for i in range(1, 6):

  print(i) # Incorrect indentation

  print("Loop finished.") # This should only run once, after the loop

  ```
          ◦ Task: Correct the indentation so that print(i) runs 5 times, and print("Loop finished.") runs only once, after the loop completes.
