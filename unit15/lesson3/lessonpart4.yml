  # Unit 3: Control Flow: Decisions and Loops


  ## Emphasis/Resources:


  * Indentation Strategy for Loops/Conditionals: This is CRITICAL.


  * Verbalizing Indentation: Teach students to mentally (or verbally) say
  "indent level 1," "indent level 2" as they navigate.


  * Block Markers (Optional but helpful): Introduce the idea of using comments
  to visually (or audibly) mark blocks, especially for longer ones.


  ```python


  if condition:
      # #start_if_block
      # ... indented code ...
      # #end_if_block
  Or just for loops:


  for item in my_list:
      # #loop_start
      # ...
      # #loop_end
  ```


  * VS Code Indent Guides: Remind them of the "indent guide" lines for visual
    users, but for screen reader users, the "indent beep/announce" is the real
    tool.

  * Boolean Logic: Walk through truth tables for and, or, not.


  ## Challenge Projects:


  1. "The Indentation Maze   - Conditional Chaos":

     * Scenario: You were writing a program to check user age and access rights, but copied some code incorrectly, messing up the indentation. The program isn't behaving as expected.

     * Code (with subtle indentation errors):

  ```python


  age = int(input("Enter your age: "))


  has_id = input("Do you have ID? (yes/no): ").lower()



  if age >= 18:


  if has_id == "yes": # This line is incorrectly indented
      print("Access granted!")
      print("Welcome.")
  else:
      print("Access denied: No ID.")
  else:
      print("Access denied: Too young.")
  ```


  * Task: Fix the indentation so that "Welcome." is only printed when age >= 18
    AND has\_id == "yes". Test with different age/ID combinations.

  1. "The Looping Labyrinth   - For Loop Fix":


  * Scenario: You tried to print numbers from 1 to 5, but the loop isn't
    working right because of indentation.

  * Code (with errors):


  ```python


  for i in range(1, 6):


  print(i) # Incorrect indentation


  print("Loop finished.") # This should only run once, after the loop


  ```


  * Task: Correct the indentation so that print(i) runs 5 times, and print("Loop
    finished.") runs only once, after the loop completes.
