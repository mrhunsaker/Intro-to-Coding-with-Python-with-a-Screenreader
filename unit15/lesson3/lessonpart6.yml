  # Unit 5: User Input and while Loops


  ## Emphasis/Resources:


  -  Infinite Loop Debugging: How to recognize an infinite loop (program doesn't
  terminate, keeps printing/asking for input) and how to stop it (Ctrl+C in
  terminal).


  -  Loop Control Flow (break, continue): Use simple scenarios to explain each:

    -  break: "Stop immediately, I found what I needed."

    -  continue: "Skip this one, but keep going with the rest."

  ## Challenge Projects:


  1. "The Endless Chatbot":

     -  Scenario: You're building a simple chatbot that should stop when the user types "quit", but it just keeps going.

     -  Code (infinite loop):

  ```python

  while True:
      message = input("Say something: ")
      if message == "hello":
          print("Hi there!")
      # Missing break condition
  ```


  -  Task: Add the necessary code so the loop breaks when the user types "quit".


  2\. "The Skipping Counter":

  \  - Scenario: You want to count from 1 to 5, but skip the number 3.

  \  - Code (without correct skip logic):


  ```python

  count = 0

  while count < 5:
      count += 1
      if count == 3:
          # What goes here?
      print(count)
  ```


  -  Task: Use a continue statement to skip printing the number 3.
