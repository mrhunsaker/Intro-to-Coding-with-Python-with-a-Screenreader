  # Resources for Additional Learning (Middle & High School)

## General Computer Science & Programming Concepts

1. CS Unplugged:

   - Description: Teaches computer science concepts through engaging, hands-on activities without a computer. Excellent for understanding algorithms, data representation, and more at a conceptual level. Many activities can be adapted for non-visual learning.

   - Accessibility: Relies on physical activities and verbal explanations. Instructors can guide students through these.

   - Link: <https://csunplugged.org/en/>
2. Khan Academy   - Computer Programming:

   - Description: Offers structured courses on computer programming (often JavaScript-based, but the concepts transfer). Their explanations are clear and have a strong focus on "talk-throughs" which can be good for screen readers.

   - Accessibility: Videos have transcripts. Exercises are interactive and may require careful screen reader navigation but are generally
   text-based.

   - Link: <https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming> (Explore sections like "Programming Basics" and "Algorithms")
3. Code.org:

   - Description: Primarily known for "Hour of Code" and introductory CS courses. While many of their activities are visual (block-based), their underlying conceptual explanations are often solid. The "unplugged" activities or discussions around programming concepts can be valuable.

   - Accessibility: Some sections may be challenging for screen readers due to drag-and-drop interfaces, but conceptual explanations are good.

   - Link: <https://code.org/>
4. Google's CS First:

   - Description: Aimed at younger students, but has good introductory concepts. Similar to Code.org, some activities are visual, but conceptual discussions are useful.

   - Accessibility: May have visual challenges, but can be a good source for instructor-led discussions.

## Python-Specific
   Resources

1. Python Crash Course (3rd Edition) by Eric Matthes:

   - Description: The primary textbook reference. It's written in a clear, straightforward style with plenty of text-based exercises.

   - Accessibility: Excellent for screen readers as it's a traditional text book. The code examples are explicitly written out.

   - Availability: Purchase physical book, or instructor may have digital copy if legally acquired. The GitHub repo pcc_3e is a direct resource for the exercises.

   - GitHub Link: <https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc_3e>
2. Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart:

   - Description: Another highly recommended book for beginners, focusing on practical applications of Python. It's freely available online.

   - Accessibility: Excellent for screen readers as it's web-based text.

   - Link: <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/> (Free online version)
3. Real Python:

   - Description: A fantastic resource with high-quality tutorials
   on almost any Python topic. Many articles are text-based and easy to navigate with a screen reader. They often provide clear code examples and explanations.

   - Accessibility: Primarily text articles, well-formatted.

   - Link: <https://realpython.com/> (Search for specific topics like "Python if else", "Python for loops", "Python dictionaries", etc.)
4. W3Schools Python Tutorial:

   - Description: A quick reference for Python syntax and concepts. Simple explanations and runnable examples (though the interactive editor might be tricky with a screen reader, the code itself is clear).

   - Accessibility: Text-based, easy to navigate.

   - Link: <https://www.w3schools.com/python/>
5. The Official Python Tutorial:

   - Description: Part of the official Python documentation. Can be dense, but it's the definitive source for Python language features. Good for deeper understanding once basics are grasped.

   - Accessibility: Highly accessible text documentation.

  
   - Link: <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>

## Specific Topic Deep Dives (Beyond Core Curriculum)

### For/While Loops & Conditional Statements (Units 3 & 5)

- Logic Puzzles (Non-visual): Provide verbal logic puzzles or text-based riddle games that require conditional thinking or iterative processes to solve.

  - Example: "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. Is it higher or lower than 50? (Continue until guessed)"   - This simulates a binary search, illustrating if/elif/else and while loops.

  - Flowchart Concepts (Verbal/Textual): Describe flowcharts verbally (e.g., "Start -> Is condition A true? -> If yes, do X; if no, do Y -> End"). This helps visualize control flow without actual visual diagrams.

### JSON Files (Unit 8)

- JSON Explained Simply:

  - Description: Focus on textual explanations of JSON's structure: it's built on key-value pairs (like Python dictionaries) and ordered lists (like Python lists). Provide very simple JSON
   examples for them to read aloud and map to Python.

  - Resource: The json.org website is the specification, but its examples are clean and good for textual parsing.

  - Example JSON for practice:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": false,
  "courses": [
    "History", 
    "Math", 
    "Science"
    ],
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Anytown"
  }
}
```

Then ask questions like: "What is John's age?", "List his courses.", "What is the street name?"

- Online JSON Validators/Formatters: While primarily visual, some online tools allow pasting JSON. Students can paste their own output and listen to the validation message ("Valid JSON" or specific error messages).

- Resource: Search "online json validator"   - ensure it gives clear text feedback.

## Indentation Strategies for Screen Readers (All Units, especially 3, 5, 6, 7)

- NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver Documentation:

- Description:
   The absolute best resource for specific screen reader settings. Encourage students to look up "indentation announcement," "tab stops," and "line navigation" features for their specific screen reader.

- Action: Instructor could prepare a short guide for common screen readers on accessing these specific settings within VS Code.

- VS Code Accessibility Docs:

- Description: Microsoft has excellent documentation on VS Code's accessibility features.

- Link: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/accessibility)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/accessibility) (Focus on "Screen Readers" and "Navigation")

- Auditory Cues for Indentation:

- Description: Practice sessions where the instructor (or a peer) reads code aloud, explicitly verbalizing indentation changes (e.g., "Line 1, no indent: def my_function():," "Line 2, 4 spaces indent: print('Hello')"). Students can try to replicate.

- Strategic Commenting (#start / #end):

- Description: Emphasize
   that this is a personal strategy for navigating complex code blocks. It's not standard Python, but can be a lifesaver.

- Example:

```python
for i in range(5):
    # #start_loop_body
    if i % 2 == 0:
        # #start_if_block
        print(f"{i} is even")
        # #end_if_block
    else:
        # #start_else_block
        print(f"{i} is odd")
        # #end_else_block
    # #end_loop_body
```

## General Debugging & Problem Solving

- Rubber Duck Debugging:

- Description: The classic technique of explaining your code, line by line, to an inanimate object (or verbally to yourself/a peer). The act of explaining often helps reveal the error.

- Accessibility: Perfectly suited for non-visual learners as it's entirely verbal.

- Reading Tracebacks:

- Description: Teach students to systematically read Python tracebacks from bottom to top, identifying the "most recent call last" and the line number where the error occurred.

- Practice: Provide snippets
   with common errors (syntax, runtime) and have students locate the error using only the traceback message.

- Print Debugging:

- Description: Using print() statements to inspect the values of variables at different points in the code.

- Accessibility: The primary and most accessible debugging technique for screen reader users.
