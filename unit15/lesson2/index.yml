title: Proofreading and Documentation Assignments
objectives: >2
      
  - Develop Proofreading Skills: Train students to identify common syntax and
  logical errors without visual cues, relying on screen reader feedback and
  careful code review.
      
  - Emphasize Accessibility Tools: Highlight how features like indentation
  announcements (from Unit 0), line-by-line navigation, and braille output can
  aid in precise code inspection.
      
  - Foster Documentation Habits: Teach the importance of clear, concise comments
  and docstrings for code readability and maintainability.
