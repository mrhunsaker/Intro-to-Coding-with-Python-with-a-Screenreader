title: Proofreading and Documentation Assignments
objectives: >-
  These assignments are designed to:
      • Develop Proofreading Skills: Train students to identify common syntax and logical errors without visual cues, relying on screen reader feedback and careful code review.
      • Emphasize Accessibility Tools: Highlight how features like indentation announcements (from Unit 0), line-by-line navigation, and braille output can aid in precise code inspection.
      • Foster Documentation Habits: Teach the importance of clear, concise comments and docstrings for code readability and maintainability.
