	# Lesson 2.1: The Software Development Process


  -  Proofreading Assignment (No code to proofread in this conceptual lesson).


	# Lesson 2.2: Elements of Programs: Expressions and Assignment


  -  Proofreading Assignment:

    -  Scenario: You're trying to perform some calculations and store results, but Python is complaining about syntax or undefined variables.

    -  Code to Proofread:

  ```python

  x = 10

  y = x + 5

  print(y)


  # Calculation error

  total = x + y -  2

  print(Total) # NameError due to capitalization


  # Assignment mistake

  another_value + 7 = 15 # Assignment target error


  current_score = 50

  current_score += 10 # This line is correct

  print(current_score)

  ```


  -  Errors to Find:

    1. NameError: Total should be total.
    2. SyntaxError: Assignment target error (another\_value + 7 = 15).

  -  Goal: Fix the NameError and SyntaxError so the program runs without
  crashing.


	# Lesson 2.3: Input and Output Revisited


  -  Proofreading Assignment:

    -  Scenario: You're building a small program to greet the user, but something's off with the input or output formatting.

    -  Code to Proofread:

  ```python

  name = input("Enter your name: ")

  age = input("Enter your age") # Missing colon/space


  print("Hello, " name) # SyntaxError: missing + or comma


  print(f"You are " + age + " years old.")

  print(f"Next year you will be {age + 1} years old.") # This will be a
  TypeError if age isn't converted

  ```


  -  Errors to Find:

    1. A stylistic/clarity error: age = input("Enter your age") should have a colon and space for better readability.
    2. SyntaxError: print("Hello, " name) needs a + or a comma.
    3. TypeError: age + 1 will fail because age is a string.

  -  Goal: Correct all errors to ensure the program runs, accepts input, and
  prints correctly formatted messages.


  -  Documentation Assignment:

    -  Scenario: The following code works, but it's not clear what each part does or what the overall purpose is.

    -  Code to Document:

  ```python

  user_name = input("What is your name? ")

  user_city = input("Which city are you from? ")

  print(f"Hello, {user_name} from {user_city}!")

  ```


  -  Task: Add a docstring for the entire script (at the very top) describing its
  purpose. Add inline comments explaining what each input() line does and what
  the print() statement achieves.


  -  Goal: Make the code understandable to someone reading it for the first time.


	# Lesson 2.4: Computing with Numbers and Type Conversions


  -  Proofreading Assignment:

    -  Scenario: You're trying to create a simple calculator, but type issues and operator precedence are causing incorrect results or crashes.

    -  Code to Proofread:

  ```python

  num_str1 = input("Enter first number: ")

  num_str2 = input("Enter second number: ")


  sum_result = num_str1 + num_str2 # String concatenation instead of addition

  print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")


  product_result = int(num_str1) -  float(num_str2)

  print(f"Product: {product_result}")


  incorrect_avg = (num_str1 + num_str2) / 2 # TypeError and logical error

  print(f"Incorrect Average: {incorrect_avg}")


  final_val = 10 + 5 -  2 # Order of operations

  print(f"Final value: {final_val}")

  ```


  -  Errors to Find:

    1. Logical Error: sum\_result performs string concatenation.
    2. TypeError and Logical Error: incorrect\_avg tries to add strings then divide.

  -  Goal: Fix the logical errors so sum\_result and incorrect\_avg perform
  correct numeric calculations.


  -  Documentation Assignment:

    -  Scenario: This code converts temperatures, but it's not well-explained.

    -  Code to Document:

  ```python

  celsius_str = input("Enter temperature in Celsius: ")

  celsius_float = float(celsius_str)

  fahrenheit = (celsius_float -  9/5) + 32

  print(f"{celsius_float}°C is {fahrenheit}°F")

  ```


  -  Task: Add a docstring to explain the script's overall function. Add inline
  comments explaining each step: input, conversion, calculation, and output.


  -  Goal: Clearly document the temperature conversion process.


	# Lesson 2.5: Using the Math Library


  -  Proofreading Assignment:

    -  Scenario: You're using the math module, but you're making mistakes with importing, function calls, or arguments.

    -  Code to Proofread:

  ```python

  import math


  value = 64

  sqrt_val = math.squareroot(value) # Typo in function name

  print(f"Square root: {sqrt_val}")


  power_val = math.pow(3, 2)

  print(f"3 to the power of 2: {power_val}")


  pi_val = math.PI # Incorrect casing for constant

  print(f"Value of PI: {pi_val}")


  # Rounding example

  num_to_round = 7.6

  rounded_down = math.floor(num_to_round)

  print(f"Rounded down: {rounded_down}")


  result_ceil = math.ceil("4.2") # TypeError: argument must be a real number

  print(f"Ceiling: {result_ceil}")

  ```


  -  Errors to Find:

    1. AttributeError: math.squareroot (should be sqrt).
    2. AttributeError: math.PI (should be math.pi).
    3. TypeError: math.ceil() called with a string.

  -  Goal: Fix all errors so the program runs and performs the intended
  mathematical operations.


  -  Documentation Assignment:

    -  Scenario: The following code calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

    -  Code to Document:

  ```python

  import math


  side_a = 3

  side_b = 4

  hypotenuse = math.sqrt(math.pow(side_a, 2) + math.pow(side_b, 2))

  print(f"The hypotenuse is: {hypotenuse}")

  ```


  -  Task: Add a docstring explaining the script's purpose (using Pythagorean
  theorem). Add inline comments for the import, variable definitions, and the
  hypotenuse calculation line.


  -  Goal: Clearly document the calculation of the hypotenuse.
