  # Unit 7: Classes and Object-Oriented Programming


  ## Lesson 7.1: Why Learn About Classes?


  * Proofreading Assignment (No code to proofread in this conceptual lesson).


  ## Lesson 7.2: Creating and Using a Class


  **Proofreading Assignment:**


  * Scenario: You're defining functions, but misusing def, forgetting
  parameters, or having indentation issues.


  * Code to Proofread:


  ```python

  class Car: # Missing colon
      def __init__(self, make, model):
          self.make = make
          model = model # This 'model' is a local variable, not an attribute

      def display_info(self):
          print(f"Make: {self.make}, Model: {self.model}") # NameError: self.model not defined

  my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry")

  my_car.display_info()

  ```


  * Errors to Find:

    * SyntaxError: Missing colon after class Car.

    * Logical Error: model = model in __init__ means self.model is never created.

    * AttributeError (or NameError depending on Python version): self.model accessed in display\_info but not defined.

  * Goal: Fix the SyntaxError and the logical error in __init__ to correctly
  assign self.model.


  **Documentation Assignment:**


  * Scenario: This code defines a Dog class and creates a dog object.


  * Code to Document:


  ```python

  class Dog:
      """
      Represents a dog with a name and age.
      """
      def __init__(self, name, age):
          self.name = name
          self.age = age

      def bark(self):
          """
          Makes the dog bark.
          """
          print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")

  my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)

  my_dog.bark()

  ```


  * Task: Ensure the docstring for the Dog class explains its purpose. Ensure
  the docstring for bark explains what it does. Add inline comments explaining
  attribute assignment in __init__ and the object creation/method call.


  * Goal: Document a simple class with attributes and methods.


  ## Lesson 7.3: Working with Attributes and Methods


  **Proofreading Assignment:**


  * Scenario: You're calling functions, but passing arguments incorrectly
  (positional vs. keyword, too many/few).


  * Code to Proofread:


  ```python

  class Robot:
      def __init__(self, name):
          self.name = name
          self.power = 100

      def decrease_power(amount): # Missing self parameter
          power -= amount # NameError: power not defined
          print(f"{self.name} power is now {self.power}") # AttributeError: self not defined

      def get_name(): # Missing self parameter
          return name # NameError: name not defined

  my_robot = Robot("R2D2")

  print(my_robot.name)

  my_robot.decrease_power(10)

  print(my_robot.get_name())

  ```


  * Errors to Find:

    * TypeError: decrease\_power and get\_name are missing the self parameter.

    * NameError: Inside decrease\_power, power should be self.power.

    * NameError: Inside get\_name, name should be self.name.

  * Goal: Fix all methods by adding self as the first parameter and using
  self.attribute when accessing attributes.


  **Documentation Assignment:**


  * Scenario: This code defines a Circle class with methods to calculate area
  and circumference.


  * Code to Document:


  ```python

  import math


  class Circle:
      """
      Represents a circle and provides methods for calculations.
      """
      def __init__(self, radius):
          self.radius = radius

      def calculate_area(self):
          """
          Calculates the area of the circle.
          """
          return math.pi * self.radius**2

      def calculate_circumference(self):
          """
          Calculates the circumference of the circle.
          """
          return 2 * math.pi * self.radius

  my_circle = Circle(5)

  print(f"Area: {my_circle.calculate_area()}")

  ```


  * Task: Ensure docstrings for Circle, calculate\_area, and
  calculate\_circumference are clear. Add inline comments explaining attribute
  assignment in __init__ and the calculation formulas.


  * Goal: Document a class with mathematical methods.


  ## Lesson 7.4: Inheritance


  **Proofreading Assignment:**


  * Scenario: You're trying to get values back from functions, but misusing
  return or expecting print() to return.


  * Code to Proofread:


  ```python

  class Animal:
      def __init__(self, name):
          self.name = name

      def speak(self):
          return "Unknown sound"

  class Dog(Animal):
      def __init__(self, name, breed):
          super().__init__(name)
          self.breed = breed

      def speak(self):
          return "Woof!"

  class Cat(Animal):
      def __init__(self, name, color):
          self.name = name # Forgetting super().__init__()
          self.color = color

      def speak(self):
          return "Meow!"

  my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")

  print(my_dog.speak())


  my_cat = Cat("Whiskers", "black")

  print(my_cat.speak())

  print(my_cat.name) # This will work, but it's not ideal for inheritance

  print(my_dog.breed)

  ```


  * Errors to Find:

    * Logical Error/Best Practice: In Cat's __init__, self.name = name directly assigns rather than calling super().__init__(name). While this doesn't cause an error for name, it bypasses any other initialization Animal might have. It's a common oversight.

  * Goal: Modify Cat's __init__ to correctly use super().__init__(name) for
  proper inheritance. Explain why super() is preferred.


  **Documentation Assignment:**


  * Scenario: This code defines a Vehicle class and a Car class that inherits
  from Vehicle.


  * Code to Document:


  ```python

  class Vehicle:
      """
      A generic class to represent a vehicle.
      """
      def __init__(self, brand):
          self.brand = brand

      def get_brand(self):
          """Returns the brand of the vehicle."""
          return self.brand

  class Car(Vehicle):
      """
      Represents a car, inheriting from Vehicle.
      """
      def __init__(self, brand, model):
          super().__init__(brand) # Initialize parent class
          self.model = model

      def get_model(self):
          """Returns the model of the car."""
          return self.model

  my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry")

  print(f"Brand: {my_car.get_brand()}, Model: {my_car.get_model()}")

  ```


  * Task: Ensure docstrings are present for both classes and their methods. Add
  an inline comment explaining super().__init__() in the Car class.


  * Goal: Document a basic inheritance setup.


  ## Lesson 7.5: Instances as Attributes


  **Proofreading Assignment:**


  * Scenario: You're passing lists/dictionaries to functions, but unexpected
  modifications or incorrect copies are happening.


  * Code to Proofread:


  ```python

  class Engine:
      def __init__(self, fuel_type):
          self.fuel_type = fuel_type

      def start(self):
          return f"Engine running on {self.fuel_type}."

  class Car:
      def __init__(self, make, model, engine_type):
          self.make = make
          self.model = model
          self.engine = Engine(engine_type) # Correct composition

      def get_engine_fuel(): # Missing self parameter
          return self.engine.fuel_type # AttributeError: self not defined

      def car_start_sound(self):
          return self.engine.start # Missing parentheses for method call

  my_car = Car("Honda", "Civic", "Gasoline")

  print(f"Car engine fuel: {my_car.get_engine_fuel()}")

  print(f"Car starts: {my_car.car_start_sound()}")

  ```


  * Errors to Find:

    * TypeError: get\_engine\_fuel is missing self.

    * AttributeError: If previous error fixed, self.engine.start is missing () for the method call.

  * Goal: Fix the TypeError by adding self to get\_engine\_fuel. Fix the
  AttributeError by adding () to self.engine.start.


  **Documentation Assignment:**


  * Scenario: This code models a Book that has an Author.


  * Code to Document:


  ```python

  class Author:
      """
      Represents an author with a name.
      """
      def __init__(self, name):
          self.name = name

      def get_name(self):
          """Returns the author's name."""
          return self.name

  class Book:
      """
      Represents a book with a title and an Author instance.
      """
      def __init__(self, title, author_name):
          self.title = title
          self.author = Author(author_name) # Composition: Book 'has a' Author

      def get_book_info(self):
          """Returns information about the book and its author."""
          return f"'{self.title}' by {self.author.get_name()}"

  author1 = Author("Jane Austen")

  book1 = Book("Pride and Prejudice", author1.name)

  print(book1.get_book_info())

  ```


  * Task: Ensure docstrings for both classes and their methods are clear. Add an
  inline comment explaining the composition in Book.__init__ and how
  self.author.get\_name() accesses the nested object's method.


  * Goal: Document a class demonstrating composition.
