  ### **Unit 1: Foundations of Computing and Getting Started with Python**


  #### **Lesson 1.1: Welcome to Computer Science**


  * **Proofreading Assignment (No code to proofread in this conceptual
  lesson).**


  #### **Lesson 1.2: Your First Python Program: "Hello World!"**


  * **Proofreading Assignment:**


  - **Scenario:** You typed out your "Hello World!" program but made a few
  common mistakes. Your screen reader might point out "unexpected character" or
  "unmatched parenthesis" errors.

  - **Code to Proofread:**
    ```
    print("Hello World"
    print "My name is Python")
    print("Nice to meet you!"
    ```
  - **Goal:** Fix all syntax errors so the program runs and prints three lines
  of output.


  #### **Lesson 1.3: Variables and Simple Data Types**


  * **Proofreading Assignment:**


  - **Scenario:** You were trying to store some information and perform a simple
  calculation, but there are typos. Listen carefully for error messages related
  to names not being defined or syntax errors.

  - **Code to Proofread:**
    ```
    greeting = "Hi there"
    name = "Alex"
    print(greeting + name)

    num1 = 5
    num2 = 2.5
    result = num1 * num2
    print("Result is: " + result) # Type error here
    my_variable = "This is a string"
    print(my_variable

    2nd_number = 10 # Invalid variable name
    ```

  * **Goal:** Correct all errors so the program runs without crashing and prints
  the concatenation and the correct result.
