  # Unit 1: Foundations of Computing and Getting Started with Python


	# Lesson 1.1: Welcome to Computer Science


  -  Proofreading Assignment (No code to proofread in this conceptual lesson).


	#Lesson 1.2: Your First Python Program: "Hello World!"
  

  -  Proofreading Assignment:

    -  Scenario: You typed out your "Hello World!" program but made a few common mistakes. Your screen reader might point out "unexpected character" or "unmatched parenthesis" errors.

    -  Code to Proofread:

      ```python
      print("Hello World"
      print "My name is Python")
      print("Nice to meet you!"
      ```

    -  Errors to Find:

      1. Missing closing parenthesis on the first print() call.
      2. `print` used as a statement instead of a function on the second line (missing parentheses).
      3. Missing closing parenthesis on the third print() call.

    -  Goal: Fix all syntax errors so the program runs and prints three lines of output.

	# Lesson 1.3: Variables and Simple Data Types


  -  Proofreading Assignment:

    -  Scenario: You were trying to store some information and perform a simple calculation, but there are typos. Listen carefully for error messages related to names not being defined or syntax errors.

    -  Code to Proofread:

      ```python
      greeting = "Hi there"
      name = "Alex"
      print(greeting + name)

      num1 = 5
      num2 = 2.5
      result = num1 -  num2
      print("Result is: " + result) # Type error here
      my_variable = "This is a string"
      print(my_variable

      2nd_number = 10 # Invalid variable name
      ```

    -  Errors to Find:

      1. Type error when concatenating a string with a number (`result`).
      2. Missing closing parenthesis on the last print() call.
      3. Invalid variable name (`2nd_number`).

    -  Goal: Correct all errors so the program runs without crashing and prints the concatenation and the correct result.
