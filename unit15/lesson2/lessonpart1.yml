  # Unit 1: Foundations of Computing and Getting Started with Python


  ## Lesson 1.1: Welcome to Computer Science



  • Proofreading Assignment (No code to proofread in this conceptual lesson).



  ## Lesson 1.2: Your First Python Program: "Hello World!"



  • Proofreading Assignment:
      ◦ Scenario: You typed out your "Hello World!" program but made a few common mistakes. Your screen reader might point out "unexpected character" or "unmatched parenthesis" errors.
      ◦ Code to Proofread:

      


  ```python

  print("Hello World"

  print "My name is Python")

  print("Nice to meet you!"

  ```


      ◦ Errors to Find:
          1. Missing closing parenthesis on the first print() call.
          2. print used as a statement instead of a function on the second line (missing parentheses).
          3. Missing closing parenthesis on the third print() call.
      ◦ Goal: Fix all syntax errors so the program runs and prints three lines of output.


  ## Lesson 1.3: Variables and Simple Data Types


  ```

  • Proofreading Assignment:
      ◦ Scenario: You were trying to store some information and perform a simple calculation, but there are typos. Listen carefully for error messages related to names not being defined or syntax errors.
      ◦ Code to Proofread:


  ```python

  greeting = "Hi there"

  name = "Alex"

  print(greeting + name)


  num1 = 5

  num2 = 2.5

  result = num1 * num2

  print("Result is: " + result) # Type error here

  my_variable = "This is a string"

  print(my_variable

  ```


  2nd\_number = 10 # Invalid variable name


      ◦ Errors to Find:
          1. Type error when concatenating a string with a number (result).
          2. Missing closing parenthesis on the last print() call.
          3. Invalid variable name (2nd_number).
      ◦ Goal: Correct all errors so the program runs without crashing and prints the concatenation and the correct result.
