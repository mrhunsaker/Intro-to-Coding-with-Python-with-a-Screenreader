  ## Unit 3: Control Flow: Decisions and Loops


  ### Lesson 3.1: Boolean Expressions and if Statements


  * Proofreading Assignment:


  * Scenario: You're writing a conditional statement, but indentation and
  comparison operators are causing issues. Listen for "indentation error"
  messages.


  * Code to Proofread:


  ```python


  age = 17



  if age >= 18:


  print("You are an adult.") # Incorrect indentation


  else:
      print("You are a minor.")

  score = 85


  if score = 85: # Assignment instead of comparison
      print("Score is exactly 85.")

  name = "Bob"


  if name != "Alice"
      print("Not Alice.") # SyntaxError: missing colon
  ```


  * Goal: Fix all errors so the program runs and the conditional logic works as
    intended.

  * Documentation Assignment:


  * Scenario: This code checks if a number is positive.


  * Code to Document:


  ```python


  number = -5


  if number > 0:
      print("The number is positive.")
  else:
      print("The number is not positive.")
  ```


  * Task: Add a docstring explaining the script's purpose. Add inline comments
    for the if and else blocks, explaining their conditions and actions.

  * Goal: Document the conditional check for a positive number.


  ### Lesson 3.2: Chained Conditionals (elif, else)


  * Proofreading Assignment:


  * Scenario: You're building a grading system, but the chained conditionals are
  messy due to indentation or logical errors.


  * Code to Proofread:


  ```python


  grade = 75



  if grade >= 90:
      print("Grade: A")
  elif grade >= 80:


  print("Grade: B") # Incorrect indentation


  elif grade >= 70:
      print("Grade: C")
  else:
      print("Grade: F")

  temp = 25


  is_raining = True



  if temp > 20 and is_raining = True: # Assignment instead of comparison for

  is_raining
      print("Warm and rainy.")
  elif temp < 10 or not is_raining:
      print("Cold or not raining.")
  ```


  * Goal: Correct all errors, including the indentation and comparison operator,
    to ensure correct grading and weather condition checks.

  * Documentation Assignment:


  * Scenario: This code checks the time of day and prints a greeting.


  * Code to Document:


  ```python


  hour = 14 # 2 PM


  if hour < 12:
      print("Good morning!")
  elif hour < 18:
      print("Good afternoon!")
  else:
      print("Good evening!")
  ```


  * Task: Add a docstring for the script. Add inline comments explaining the
    conditions for "Good morning," "Good afternoon," and "Good evening."

  * Goal: Document the time-based greeting logic.


  ### Lesson 3.3: Introduction to Lists


  * Proofreading Assignment:


  * Scenario: You're creating and accessing lists, but common mistakes with
  brackets and indexing are causing issues.


  * Code to Proofread:


  ```python


  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry" # Missing closing bracket


  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]



  first_fruit = fruits[0]


  print(first_fruit)



  second_number = numbers[2] # Accessing the third element


  print(second_number)



  last_fruit = fruits[len(fruits)] # IndexError: out of bounds


  print(last_fruit)



  fruits[1] = "grape"


  print(fruits)

  ```


  * Goal: Fix the syntax error and the IndexError so the program runs and list
    operations are correct.

  * Documentation Assignment:


  * Scenario: This code defines a list of colors and prints the second color.


  * Code to Document:


  ```python


  colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow"]


  print(colors[1])


  ```


  * Task: Add a docstring explaining the list's purpose. Add an inline comment
    next to the print() statement explaining what colors\[1] accesses.

  * Goal: Document list creation and element access.


  ### Lesson 3.4: Iterating with for Loops


  * Proofreading Assignment:


  * Scenario: Your for loops aren't iterating correctly due to indentation,
  missing colons, or incorrect range() usage.


  * Code to Proofread:


  ```python


  items = ["pen", "notebook", "eraser"]


  for item in items # Missing colon
      print(item) # Incorrect indentation

  # Loop with range


  for i in range(5) # Missing colon


  print(i) # Incorrect indentation



  # Loop with incorrect range


  for j in range(1, 1): # This loop won't run
      print(f"J is {j}")

  # Correct loop (for comparison)


  for k in range(3):
      print(f"K is {k}")
  ```


  * Goal: Fix all errors so both loops run correctly and the indentation is
    proper.

  * Documentation Assignment:


  * Scenario: This code prints numbers from 0 to 4 using a for loop.


  * Code to Document:


  ```python


  for number in range(5):
      print(number)
  ```


  * Task: Add a docstring for the script. Add an inline comment explaining what
    range(5) does and what the loop iterates over.

  * Goal: Document a basic for loop with range().


  ### Lesson 3.5: Basic String Operations


  * Proofreading Assignment:


  * Scenario: You're working with strings, but method calls, assignments, or
  concatenation are causing problems.


  * Code to Proofread:


  ```python


  message = "   Hello Python!   "


  clean_message = message.strip # Missing parentheses for method call


  print(clean_message)



  long_text = "This is a long sentence."


  upper_text = long_text.toupper() # Typo in method name


  print(upper_text)



  name = "Alice"


  age = 30


  greeting = "My name is " + name + " and I am " + str(age) + " years old."


  print(greeting)



  # Replacement error


  sentence = "I like apples, do you like apples?"


  new_sentence = sentence.replace("apple", "banana") # Correct


  print(new_sentence)



  bad_replace = sentence.replace("oranges", "grapes") # No error, but doesn't do

  anything


  print(bad_replace)



  len_of_msg = len[message] # TypeError: len() expects an iterable, not a list

  of one item


  print(len_of_msg)


  ```


  * Goal: Fix all errors so string operations work as intended.


  * Documentation Assignment:


  * Scenario: This code cleans and capitalizes a user's input.


  * Code to Document:


  ```python


  user_input = input("Enter a phrase: ")


  cleaned_input = user_input.strip().upper()


  print(f"Cleaned and capitalized: {cleaned_input}")


  ```


  * Task: Add a docstring explaining the script's purpose. Add inline comments
    explaining the steps of getting input, stripping whitespace, and converting to
    uppercase.

  * Goal: Document string cleaning and transformation.
