  ## Unit 4: Data Structures: Lists and Dictionaries


  ### Lesson 4.1: More on Lists


  -  Proofreading Assignment:

    -  Scenario: You're trying to modify a list, but you're making mistakes with methods or indexing.

    -  Code to Proofread:

    ```python
    my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

    my_list.add(60) # Incorrect method for adding to end
    print(my_list)

    my_list.insert(1, "hello") # Correct
    print(my_list)

    del my_list[len(my_list)] # IndexError: deleting out of bounds
    print(my_list)

    removed_item = my_list.pop() # Correct
    print(f"Removed: {removed_item}, List: {my_list}")

    my_list.remove(20) # Correct
    print(my_list)

    my_list.remove(99) # ValueError: not in list
    print(my_list)
    ```

    -  Errors to Find:

      1. AttributeError: my\_list.add() (should be append()).
      2. IndexError: del my\_list\[len(my\_list)] tries to delete beyond the list's bounds.
      3. ValueError: my\_list.remove(99) if 99 is not in the list.

    -  Goal: Fix the AttributeError and IndexError. Handle the potential ValueError with a try-except block, printing a message if the item isn't found.

  -  Documentation Assignment:

    -  Scenario: This code demonstrates several ways to modify a list.

    -  Code to Document:

    ```python
    shopping_list = ["milk", "bread"]
    shopping_list.append("eggs")
    shopping_list.insert(0, "cheese")
    del shopping_list[1]
    print(shopping_list)
    ```

    -  Task: Add a docstring explaining the list modifications. Add inline comments for append(), insert(), and del to explain what each line does.

    -  Goal: Document common list modification methods.

  ### Lesson 4.2: Organizing Lists


  -  Proofreading Assignment:

    -  Scenario: You're trying to sort and reverse lists, but misusing methods or forgetting argument names.

    -  Code to Proofread:

    ```python
    names = ["Charlie", "Bob", "Alice"]
    names.sort(True) # TypeError: sort() takes no positional arguments
    print(names)

    numbers = [5, 1, 8, 2]
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers) # Correct
    print(sorted_numbers)

    original_numbers = [9, 3, 7]
    original_numbers.reverse # Missing parentheses for method call
    print(original_numbers)

    length_of_list = len[numbers] # TypeError: len() takes a single argument
    print(length_of_list)
    ```

    -  Errors to Find:

      1. TypeError: names.sort(True) (should be reverse=True).
      2. TypeError or AttributeError: original\_numbers.reverse needs ().
      3. TypeError: len\[numbers] should be len(numbers).

    -  Goal: Fix all errors so the list sorting and reversing operations work correctly.

  -  Documentation Assignment:

    -  Scenario: This code sorts a list of scores and prints it in both ascending and descending order.

    -  Code to Document:

    ```python
    scores = [95, 80, 75, 90]
    scores.sort()
    print("Ascending:", scores)
    scores.sort(reverse=True)
    print("Descending:", scores)
    ```

    -  Task: Add a docstring explaining the sorting operations. Add inline comments explaining what each sort() call does.

    -  Goal: Document in-place list sorting.

  ### Lesson 4.3: Tuples: Immutable Lists


  -  Proofreading Assignment:

    -  Scenario: You're using tuples, but trying to modify them or using incorrect syntax.

    -  Code to Proofread:

    ```python
    coordinates = (10, 20, 30] # SyntaxError: mixed parentheses and brackets
    print(coordinates)

    first_coord = coordinates[0]
    print(first_coord)

    coordinates[1] = 25 # TypeError: tuples are immutable
    print(coordinates)

    # Looping through a tuple
    for coord in coordinates:
        print(coord)
    ```

    -  Errors to Find:

      1. SyntaxError: coordinates definition uses mixed brackets.
      2. TypeError: coordinates\[1] = 25 attempts to modify an immutable tuple.

    -  Goal: Fix the SyntaxError and explain why the TypeError occurs, then comment out the line causing the TypeError.

  -  Documentation Assignment:

    -  Scenario: This code defines a tuple of weekdays and prints them.

    -  Code to Document:

    ```python
    weekdays = ("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
    for day in weekdays:
        print(day)
    ```

    -  Task: Add a docstring explaining what a tuple is and its purpose in this code. Add an inline comment for the for loop explaining its function.

    -  Goal: Document tuple creation and iteration.

  ### Lesson 4.4: Introducing Dictionaries


  -  Proofreading Assignment:

    -  Scenario: You're working with dictionaries, but making mistakes with curly braces, keys, or access.

    -  Code to Proofread:

    ```python
    person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25 # Missing closing curly brace
    print(person)

    person["city"] = "New York" # Adding a new key-value pair
    print(person)

    print(person[Name]) # NameError: string literal needed for key

    del person["age"] # Correct
    print(person)

    person["age"] = "twenty-five" # Correct, but perhaps unintended type
    print(person)
    ```

    -  Errors to Find:

      1. SyntaxError: person dictionary is missing a closing curly brace.
      2. NameError: person\[Name] should use a string literal "name".

    -  Goal: Fix the syntax error and the NameError so dictionary operations are correct.

  -  Documentation Assignment:

    -  Scenario: This code defines a dictionary for a student's profile and prints some of its details.

    -  Code to Document:

    ```python
    student_profile = {
        "id": 101,
        "name": "Jane Doe",
        "major": "Computer Science",
        "gpa": 3.8
    }
    print(f"Student Name: {student_profile['name']}")
    student_profile["gpa"] = 3.9
    print(f"Updated GPA: {student_profile['gpa']}")
    ```

    -  Task: Add a docstring explaining what a dictionary is and its use here. Add inline comments explaining how to access data, and how to update a value.

    -  Goal: Document dictionary creation, access, and modification.

  ### Lesson 4.5: Looping Through Dictionaries


  -  Proofreading Assignment:

    -  Scenario: You're trying to loop through dictionary keys, values, or items, but common errors are occurring.

    -  Code to Proofread:

    ```python
    inventory = {"apple": 10, "banana": 5, "orange": 8}

    for item in inventory: # Loops through keys
        print(item)

    for count in inventory.value(): # Typo in method name
        print(count)

    for k, v in inventory.items # Missing parentheses for method call
        print(f"{k}: {v}")

    # Intentional logical error (no error, just doesn't do what's expected)

    for key in inventory.values():
        print(key) # This will print values, not keys
    ```

    -  Errors to Find:

      1. AttributeError: inventory.value() should be inventory.values().
      2. TypeError or AttributeError: inventory.items needs ().

    -  Goal: Fix the AttributeError and TypeError. Discuss the logical error for extra credit.

  -  Documentation Assignment:

    -  Scenario: This code iterates through a dictionary of product prices.

    -  Code to Document:

    ```python
    product_prices = {
        "laptop": 1200,
        "mouse": 25,
        "keyboard": 75
    }
    for product, price in product_prices.items():
        print(f"The {product} costs ${price}.")
    ```

    -  Task: Add a docstring for the script. Add inline comments explaining the use of .items() and how product and price variables are assigned in the loop.

    -  Goal: Document iterating through dictionary items.
