  # Unit 8: Files and Exceptions


  ## Lesson 8.1: Reading from a File


  * Proofreading Assignment:

    * Scenario: You're trying to read from a file, but common errors like FileNotFoundError or incorrect method usage are occurring.

    * Code to Proofread:

  ```python

  # Assuming 'non_existent_file.txt' does not exist

  with open("non_existent_file.txt", "r") as file: # FileNotFoundError if not
  handled
      content = file.read()
      print(content)

  # Assuming 'my_data.txt' exists with "Line 1\nLine 2\n"

  with open("my_data.txt", "r") as f:
      lines = f.readline() # This only reads one line
      print(lines)

      all_lines = f.readall() # AttributeError: 'io.TextIOWrapper' object has no attribute 'readall'
      print(all_lines)

  # To prepare for proofreading, create a file named 'my_data.txt' with some
  content

  # Example content for my_data.txt:

  # Line 1

  # Line 2

  # Line 3

  ```


  * Errors to Find:

    * FileNotFoundError: For non\_existent\_file.txt.

    * Logical Error: f.readline() only reads one line. The intention was likely to read all.

    * AttributeError: f.readall() is not a valid method (should be f.read() or f.readlines()).

  * Goal: Handle the FileNotFoundError with a try-except block. Correct the
  logical error to read all lines. Fix the AttributeError.


    - Documentation Assignment:

    * Scenario: This code reads the entire content of a file named sample.txt.

    * Code to Document:

  ```python

  # Ensure 'sample.txt' exists in the same directory as this script

  # with some text content.

  with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
      content = file.read()
      print(content)
  ```


  ```

    - Task: Add a docstring for the script. Add inline comments explaining with
  open(), the "r" mode, and .read().

    - Goal: Document reading an entire file.

  ```


  ## Lesson 8.2: Writing to a File


  * Proofreading Assignment:

    * Scenario: You're writing to files, but using the wrong modes or forgetting newlines.

    * Code to Proofread:

  ```python

  # Writing a new file

  with open("output.txt", "r") as file: # Wrong mode for writing
      file.write("Hello, world!")

  # Appending to a file

  with open("log.txt", "w") as log_file: # Wrong mode, will overwrite
      log_file.write("First log entry.")
      log_file.write("Second log entry.") # Missing newline

  # This part should be correct if the first parts are fixed

  # Ensure 'new_output.txt' is ready

  with open("new_output.txt", "a") as f:
      f.write("Appended line.\n")
  ```


  * Errors to Find:

    * UnsupportedOperation: open("output.txt", "r") cannot be used for writing.

    * Logical Error: open("log.txt", "w") will overwrite. It should be "a" for appending if multiple calls are intended to add.

    * Logical Error: log\_file.write("Second log entry.") is missing a newline, so it will append on the same line.

  * Goal: Fix the UnsupportedOperation by changing the file mode. Change the
  log.txt open mode to append. Add a newline character to the second log entry.


    - Documentation Assignment:

    * Scenario: This code writes two lines to a new file called my\_notes.txt.

    * Code to Document:

  ```python

  with open("my_notes.txt", "w") as file:
      file.write("This is the first line.\n")
      file.write("This is the second line.\n")
  print("Notes written to my_notes.txt")

  ```


  * Task: Add a docstring for the script. Add inline comments explaining the "w"
  mode and the use of \n.


  * Goal: Document writing to a file.


  ## Lesson 8.3: Exceptions: Handling Errors


  * Proofreading Assignment:

    * Scenario: You're trying to handle exceptions, but either not catching the right one, or the try-except block is placed incorrectly.

    * Code to Proofread:

  ```python

  # Division by zero

  try:
      result = 10 / 0
  except ValueError: # Wrong exception type
      print("Caught a value error!")
  print("Program continues after division.")


  # File not found

  try:
      with open("non_existent.txt", "r") as f:
          content = f.read()
          print(content)
  except ZeroDivisionError: # Wrong exception type
      print("Caught a division by zero error!")

  # Invalid input for int()

  user_input_num = input("Enter a number: ")

  result = int(user_input_num) # Error will occur outside try-except if not
  numeric

  try:
      print(f"Your number is: {result}")
  except ValueError:
      print("Invalid input for number.")
  ```


  * Errors to Find:

    * Logical Error: First try-except block catches ValueError for a ZeroDivisionError.

    * Logical Error: Second try-except block catches ZeroDivisionError for a FileNotFoundError.

    * Logical Error: Third try-except block places the int() conversion outside the try, so ValueError won't be caught correctly.

  * Goal: Correctly identify and handle ZeroDivisionError and FileNotFoundError.
  Move the int() conversion into the try block for the third scenario.


    - Documentation Assignment:

    * Scenario: This code attempts a division and handles a potential ZeroDivisionError.

    * Code to Document:

  ```python

  try:
      numerator = 10
      denominator = int(input("Enter a denominator: "))
      result = numerator / denominator
      print(f"Result: {result}")
  except ZeroDivisionError:
      print("Error: Cannot divide by zero!")
  except ValueError:
      print("Error: Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
  ```


  * Task: Add a docstring for the script. Add inline comments explaining the try
  block, each except block, and the specific errors they catch.


  * Goal: Document robust error handling for division.


  ## Lesson 8.4: The else Block and finally Block


  * Proofreading Assignment:

    * Scenario: You're using else and finally with try-except, but they're not always placed or behaving as expected.

    * Code to Proofread:

  ```python

  # Scenario 1: else block

  def safe_divide(a, b):
      try:
          result = a / b
      except ZeroDivisionError:
          print("Division by zero error!")
      else: # This else should be for the try, not just print
          print(f"Division successful: {result}")
      finally: # This finally should be for the try, not just print
          print("Safe divide function finished.")

  safe_divide(10, 2)

  safe_divide(10, 0)


  # Scenario 2: finally block

  file_name = "data.txt" # Assume this file exists

  try:
      f = open(file_name, "r")
      content = f.read()
      print(content)
  except FileNotFoundError:
      print(f"File {file_name} not found.")
  finally:
      f.close() # This will cause NameError if FileNotFoundError occurs and f isn't defined
  ```


  * Errors to Find:

    * Logical Error: In safe\_divide, the else and finally are not properly aligned with the try block in Python syntax. They are part of the try-except construct.

    * NameError: In the file handling scenario, if FileNotFoundError occurs, f is never assigned, so f.close() in finally will raise a NameError.

  * Goal: Correct the indentation and placement of else and finally in
  safe\_divide. Modify the file handling finally block to only close f if it was
  successfully opened (e.g., by initializing f = None before the try).


    - Documentation Assignment:

    * Scenario: This code attempts to open and read a file, always printing a completion message.

    * Code to Document:

  ```python

  file_path = "existing_file.txt" # Assume this file exists

  try:
      with open(file_path, "r") as f:
          content = f.read()
          print(f"File content: {content}")
  except FileNotFoundError:
      print(f"Error: {file_path} not found.")
  else:
      print("File reading was successful.")
  finally:
      print("File operation attempted.")
  ```


  * Task: Add a docstring for the script. Add inline comments for the try,
  except, else, and finally blocks, explaining when each block executes.


  * Goal: Document the full try-except-else-finally structure.


  ## Lesson 8.5: Storing Data with JSON


  * Proofreading Assignment:

    * Scenario: You're trying to save and load data using JSON, but common mistakes with the json module or file handling are occurring.

    * Code to Proofread:

  ```python

  import json


  data_to_save = {"name": "Test User", "id": 123}


  # Saving data

  with open("user_data.json", "w") as f:
      f.write(json.dumps(data_to_save)) # Missing newline, also dump() is better

  # Loading data

  try:
      with open("user_data.json", "r") as f:
          loaded_data = json.load(f)
          print(f"Loaded data: {loaded_data}")
  except json.JSONDecodeError:
      print("Error: JSON file is corrupted.")
  except FileNotFoundError:
      print("Error: JSON file not found.")

  # Incorrect JSON structure in file

  # Assume a file named 'bad_data.json' exists with content:

  # {"item": 10, "value": 20, "extra_comma": } # Malformed JSON

  try:
      with open("bad_data.json", "r") as f:
          corrupted_data = json.load(f)
          print(f"Corrupted data: {corrupted_data}")
  except FileNotFoundError:
      print("Bad data file not found.")
  except ValueError: # Wrong exception type for JSON corruption
      print("Caught a ValueError!")
  ```


  * Errors to Find:

    * Logical/Best Practice: When writing JSON, it's better to use json.dump(data, file\_object) directly, rather than json.dumps() and then f.write(). Also, f.write(json.dumps(data\_to\_save)) won't add a newline, so if you append later, it'll be on the same line.

    * Logical Error: The except block for bad\_data.json catches ValueError when it should catch json.JSONDecodeError.

  * Goal: Change f.write(json.dumps(...)) to json.dump(data\_to\_save, f).
  Change the exception type for bad\_data.json to json.JSONDecodeError.


    - Documentation Assignment:

    * Scenario: This code saves a list of dictionaries (representing contacts) to a JSON file and then loads it back.

    * Code to Document:

  ```python

  import json


  contacts = [
      {"name": "Alice", "phone": "111-222-3333"},
      {"name": "Bob", "phone": "444-555-6666"}
  ]


  # Save contacts to JSON file

  with open("contacts.json", "w") as f:
      json.dump(contacts, f, indent=4) # indent makes it human-readable

  # Load contacts from JSON file

  with open("contacts.json", "r") as f:
      loaded_contacts = json.load(f)

  print("Loaded Contacts:")

  for contact in loaded_contacts:
      print(f"  - Name: {contact['name']}, Phone: {contact['phone']}")
  ```


  * Task: Add a docstring for the script. Add inline comments explaining
  json.dump() with the indent argument, and json.load().


  * Goal: Document saving and loading structured data with JSON.
