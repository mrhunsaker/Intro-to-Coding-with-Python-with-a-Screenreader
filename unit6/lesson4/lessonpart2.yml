  # Lesson: Using continue in Loops

  ## Skipping parts of an iteration

  `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration.

  ## Explicit Examples

  ## Example 5.4.1: Printing Odd Numbers

  ```python
  number = 0
  while number < 10:
     number += 1
     if number % 2 == 0:
         continue
     print(number)
  ```

  Expected Output:

  ```
  1
  3
  5
  7
  9
  ```

  ## Activities

  1. **Activity 5.4.1: Skip the Vowels**

     * Create `skip_vowels.py`.

     * Prompt for a word or phrase.

     * Use a for loop to print only consonants.

  2. **Activity 5.4.2: Deli Order (No Pastrami)**

     * Create `deli_order.py`.

     * Start with a list of sandwich orders.

     * Use a while loop and `continue` to skip "pastrami".

        type: multiple
        content: What does the `continue` statement do in a loop?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: It skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next
              iteration.
            explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration
              and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: It exits the loop completely.
            explanation: Exiting the loop completely is done using the `break` statement,
              not `continue`.
          - id: "3"
            value: It pauses the loop until a condition is met.
            explanation: Pausing the loop until a condition is met is not the function of
              `continue`.
          - id: "4"
            value: It restarts the loop from the beginning.
            explanation: Restarting the loop from the beginning is not the function of
              `continue`.

        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: To skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration.
            explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration
              and proceeds to the next iteration.
            isCorrect: true

            value: To exit the loop entirely.
            explanation: Exiting the loop entirely is done using the `break` statement, not
              `continue`.
          - id: "3"
            value: To pause the loop until a condition is met.
            explanation: Pausing the loop until a condition is met is not the function of
              the `continue` statement.

        type: reflection
        content: Reflect on how the `continue` statement can be used to improve the
          efficiency of a loop. Can you think of a scenario in a real-world
          application where skipping certain iterations might be beneficial?
          Describe the scenario and how you would implement it using a
          `continue` statement.
