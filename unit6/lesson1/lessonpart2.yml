- # Lesson: How the input() Function Works


  ## Getting user input and its default string type


  The `input()` function always reads user input as a string. Use type
  conversion functions for numeric input.


  ## Explicit Examples


  ## Example 5.1.1: Input Type Demonstration


  ```python

  age_input = input("How old are you? ")

  print(f"You entered: {age_input}, which is a {type(age_input)}")


  # print(age_input + 5) # Will error


  age_int = int(age_input)

  print(f"In 5 years, you will be: {age_int + 5}")

  ```


  Expected Output:


  ```

  How old are you? 14

  You entered: 14, which is a <class 'str'>

  In 5 years, you will be: 19

  ```


  ## Activities


  1. **Activity 5.1.1: Simple Survey**
