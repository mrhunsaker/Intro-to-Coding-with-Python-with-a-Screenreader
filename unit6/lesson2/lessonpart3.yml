  # Lesson 5.2: The while Loop in Action 

  ## Student Materials: 
    - Outline: 
      -  Introduction to while loops: repeating code as long as a condition is true. 
      -  Distinction from for loops (definite vs. indefinite iteration). 
      -  Defining the loop condition (a Boolean expression). 
      -  Ensuring the condition eventually becomes false to avoid infinite loops. 
      -  Incrementing/decrementing a counter within the loop to control repetitions. 
      -  Understanding the indentation of the code block under while. 
    - Skills Checklist: 
      -  [ ] I can explain the difference between a for loop and a while loop. 
      -  [ ] I can write a basic while loop. 
      -  [ ] I can define the condition that controls a while loop. 
      -  [ ] I can make sure my while loop has a way to stop (avoiding infinite loops). 
      -  [ ] I can correctly indent the code block belonging to a while loop.
