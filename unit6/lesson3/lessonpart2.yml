  # Lesson: Using Flags and break to Exit Loops

  ## Controlling loop termination

  A flag variable signals when to stop. `break` exits the loop immediately.

  ## Explicit Examples

  ## Example 5.3.1: Using a Flag to Control a Loop

  ```python
  active = True
  while active:
     message = input("Say something (or 'quit' to stop): ")
     if message == 'quit':
         active = False
     else:
         print(f"You said: {message}")
  print("Conversation ended.")
  ```

  ## Example 5.3.2: Using break to Exit Early

  ```python
  while True:
     city = input("Enter a city you've visited (or 'done' to finish): ")
     if city == 'done':
         break
     print(f"I've heard {city} is a great place!")
  print("Thanks for sharing your travel experiences!")
  ```

  ## Activities

  1. **Activity 5.3.1: Pizza Toppings Order**

     * Create `pizza_toppings.py`.

     * Use a while loop to prompt for toppings (or 'quit').

     * Use `break` to exit.

     * Print confirmation and final message.

  2. **Activity 5.3.2: User Name Collector**

     * Create `name_collector.py`.

     * Initialize an empty list `names`.

     * Use a while loop to prompt for names (or 'done').

     * Add names to the list.

     * Print all collected names.

        content: What is the purpose of a flag variable in a loop?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: To signal when to stop the loop.
            explanation: A flag variable is used to control the loop's execution by
              indicating when it should terminate.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: To immediately exit the loop.
            explanation: The 'break' statement is used to immediately exit the loop, not a
              flag variable.
          - id: "3"
            value: To count the number of iterations.
            explanation: A counter variable, not a flag, is typically used to count
              iterations.

        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: It immediately exits the loop when executed.
            explanation: The 'break' statement is used to exit the loop immediately.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: It pauses the loop execution temporarily.
            explanation: The 'break' statement does not pause the loop; it exits it.
          - id: "3"
            value: It restarts the loop from the beginning.
            explanation: The 'break' statement does not restart the loop; it exits it.

        content: Reflect on the examples provided in this lesson. How do the use of flag
          variables and the 'break' statement differ in controlling loop
          termination? Which method do you find more intuitive, and why?
