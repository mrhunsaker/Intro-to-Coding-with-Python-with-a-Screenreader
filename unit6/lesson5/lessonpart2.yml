  # Lesson: Avoiding Infinite Loops

  ## Common pitfalls and how to prevent them

  An infinite loop occurs when the condition never becomes False.

  ## Explicit Examples

  ## Example 5.5.1: Accidental Infinite Loop

  ```python
  count = 1
  while count <= 5:
     print(count)
     # count += 1  # MISSING!
  print("Finished!")
  ```
  Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  1
  1
  ... (continues indefinitely)
  ```

  ## Example 5.5.2: Corrected Loop

  ```python
  count = 1
  while count <= 5:
     print(count)
     count += 1
  print("Finished!")
  ```
  Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  Finished!
  ```

  ## Activities

  1. **Activity 5.5.1: Spot the Infinite Loop**
      - Create `loop_debug.py`.
      - Examine code snippets and identify/fix infinite loops.
