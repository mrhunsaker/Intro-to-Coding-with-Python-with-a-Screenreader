content: "Lesson 9.1: Testing a Function • Student Materials: ◦ Outline: ▪ The
  importance of testing: ensuring code works as expected, catching bugs early. ▪
  Introduction to unit testing: testing individual functions or small code
  units. ▪ The unittest module: Python's built-in testing framework. ▪ Basic
  structure of a test class inheriting from unittest.TestCase. ▪ Test methods
  starting with test_. ▪ Assertion methods: self.assertEqual(a, b),
  self.assertTrue(condition), self.assertFalse(condition). ▪ Running tests from
  the terminal (python -m unittest my_tests.py). ◦ Skills Checklist: ▪ [ ] I can
  explain why testing is important in programming. ▪ [ ] I can create a basic
  test class using unittest.TestCase. ▪ [ ] I can define test methods within a
  test class. ▪ [ ] I can use self.assertEqual() to check for expected results.
  ▪ [ ] I can use self.assertTrue() and self.assertFalse() for boolean
  conditions. ▪ [ ] I can run unit tests from the terminal."
