  Lesson 9.1: Testing a Function
      • Student Materials:
          ◦ Outline:
              ▪ The importance of testing: ensuring code works as expected, catching bugs early.
              ▪ Introduction to unit testing: testing individual functions or small code units.
              ▪ The unittest module: Python's built-in testing framework.
              ▪ Basic structure of a test class inheriting from unittest.TestCase.
              ▪ Test methods starting with test_.
              ▪ Assertion methods: self.assertEqual(a, b), self.assertTrue(condition), self.assertFalse(condition).
              ▪ Running tests from the terminal (python -m unittest my_tests.py).
          ◦ Skills Checklist:
              ▪ [ ] I can explain why testing is important in programming.
              ▪ [ ] I can create a basic test class using unittest.TestCase.
              ▪ [ ] I can define test methods within a test class.
              ▪ [ ] I can use self.assertEqual() to check for expected results.
              ▪ [ ] I can use self.assertTrue() and self.assertFalse() for boolean conditions.
              ▪ [ ] I can run unit tests from the terminal.
