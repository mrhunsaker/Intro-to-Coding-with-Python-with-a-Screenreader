  # Lesson: Analyzing Text Data

  ## Counting words, frequency analysis, and basic string processing.

  ## Example 9.4.1: Word Count and Character Count

  ```python
  text = "Python is a powerful and versatile programming language."
  print(f"Original text: '{text}'")

  words = text.split()
  word_count = len(words)
  print(f"Total words: {word_count}")

  char_count = len(text)
  print(f"Total characters (including spaces): {char_count}")

  char_no_spaces = len(text.replace(" ", ""))
  print(f"Total characters (excluding spaces): {char_no_spaces}")
  ```

  ## Example 9.4.2: Simple Word Frequency

  ```python
  sentence = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog the quick brown fox"
  words_in_sentence = sentence.lower().split()

  word_frequencies = {}
  for word in words_in_sentence:
     if word in word_frequencies:
         word_frequencies[word] += 1
     else:
         word_frequencies[word] = 1

  print("\nWord Frequencies:")
  for word, count in word_frequencies.items():
     print(f"'{word}': {count}")
  ```
