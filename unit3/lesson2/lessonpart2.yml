  ## Understanding how Python evaluates expressions and assigns values to

  variables.



  In Python, expressions are segments of code that produce a value, such as `5 +

  3`, `"Hello" + "World"`, or `age * 2`. Assignment uses the `=` operator to

  store the result of an expression into a variable.



  ## Explicit Examples



  ## Example 2.2.1: Expression Evaluation



  ```python


  result1 = 10 / 2 + 3  # 10 / 2 is 5, then 5 + 3 is 8


  print("Result 1:", result1)



  message = "Python" + " " + "is fun!" # Strings are joined together


  print("Message:", message)


  ```



  Expected Output:



  ```


  Result 1: 8.0


  Message: Python is fun!


  ```



  ## Example 2.2.2: Reassigning Variables



  ```python


  score = 50


  print("Initial score:", score)


  score = score + 20 # score becomes 50 + 20 = 70


  print("New score:", score)


  ```



  Expected Output:



  ```


  Initial score: 50


  New score: 70


  ```



  ## Activities



  1. **Activity 2.2.1: Predict the Output**

     * Instructions: For each code snippet provided, students must predict what the final print statements will output. After writing down their predictions, they should run the code to verify their answers.

     * Snippet A:

       ```python
       x = 7
       y = x * 2
       x = x + 1
       print("X is:", x)
       print("Y is:", y)
       ```

     * Snippet B:

       ```python
       greeting = "Hi"
       name = "Alex"
       full_message = greeting + ", " + name + "!"
       greeting = "Hello" # This won't change full_message
       print(full_message)
       print(greeting)
       ```

     * Purpose: Deepen understanding of expression evaluation and variable assignment order.

     * Accessibility: Type predictions and compare with actual output in the terminal.
