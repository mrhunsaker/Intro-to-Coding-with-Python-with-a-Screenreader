  Lesson 2.1: The Software Development Process
      • Student Materials:
          ◦ Outline:
              ▪ Introduction to the structured approach of building software.
              ▪ Phases of software development:
                  • Problem Solving/Analysis: Understanding what needs to be done.
                  • Design: Planning how to solve the problem (e.g., what steps, what data).
                  • Implementation/Coding: Writing the actual Python code.
                  • Testing: Checking if the code works as expected and finding bugs.
                  • Maintenance: Updating and improving the code over time.
              ▪ Emphasis on iterative development (doing small cycles of these steps).
          ◦ Skills Checklist:
              ▪ [ ] I can describe the purpose of the software development process.
